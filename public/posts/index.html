      This weekend is a special weekend for me. On Saturday, I will celebrate 11 years of marriage with my brilliant, amazing, strong and determined wife, Elyse. And on Sunday, we will celebrate Elyse‚Äôs birthday, and Father‚Äôs Day.
This weekend, in many ways, is a celebration of my life. The beauty of this weekend is I can share it with those I love most. And while the commercial world says I need to go out and buy something made of steel for our anniversary, and buy some trinket or some other gift for Elyse‚Äôs birthday.

      Being between jobs, I spend a lot of time trying to keep myself busy during the day. I tend to do a lot of chores and small projects that have gone neglected. Over the last 2 months, the small projects have led several afternoon shopping runs. During my shopping runs, I tend to swing through the toy section and see about something small for the kids.
When I was a kid, Barbie dominated the toy section.

I thought that I had written all that needed to be said about the decietful, misogynist, forced-birth advocating, so called &ldquo;secular pro life&rdquo; movement two years ago. I didn&rsquo;t realize then that the current mostly-male &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; of the secular movement was composed almost entirely of misogynists, abusers, liars, and morally-bankrupt cowards. Those who are not anti-woman seem to be so obsessed with courting &ldquo;allies&rdquo; that they have no problems throwing women under the bus to advance their petty agendas.

      I have supported and also criticized American Atheists over the years. Today I&rsquo;m frustrated and am offering some criticism. Criticism that I hope is listened too. I&rsquo;m an atheist and I want atheist organizations to prosper, but I also want them to reflect my values.
Today AA issues a new press release&amp; announcing six new billboards.
 American Atheists launched six billboards on Monday in central New Jersey attacking the non-helpful responses by some religions to recent natural disasters.

      There is an event happening in Ohio on November 2nd that might shock and surprise you for many reasons. It&rsquo;s an event to celebrate&amp; &amp; D√≠a de Muertos, the Mexican holiday to commemorate and celebrate reflect upon your dead ancestors and loved ones, with a BDSM play party. We&rsquo;re grown ups and we know people have sex and even have kinky sex in groups. The part that may be a shock for some is that the organizer of the event is a self-described &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; educator.

      Dear Mr Zuckerberg,
It must be pretty awesome to be a white dude with billions of dollars. It must be nice to be able to afford peace of mind. You do realize that not everyone is a billionaire right? Because when Facebook makes decisions to allow any timeline to be found by name alone that&rsquo;s seriously messed up. Your suggestions to make things more secure are laughable:
   Share each post with the people you want to be able to see it.

From one cis hetero white man to another: Shut the fuck up.
I realize none of this is likely to make much of a difference to you, because you&rsquo;re not about accountability or criticism. No, not you Hugo. But you&rsquo;re hurting people. You are being an abuser. You are verbally abusing women of color, and then you apologize and cry about your mental illness and &ldquo;go away&rdquo;&hellip;but you come back.
