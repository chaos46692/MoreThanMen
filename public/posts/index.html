<p>This weekend is a special weekend for me.  On Saturday, I will celebrate 11 years of marriage with my brilliant, amazing, strong and determined wife, Elyse.  And on Sunday, we will celebrate Elyse‚Äôs birthday, and Father‚Äôs Day.</p>
<p>This weekend, in many ways, is a celebration of my life.  The beauty of this weekend is I can share it with those I love most.  And while the commercial world says I need to go out and buy something made of steel for our anniversary, and buy some trinket or some other gift for Elyse‚Äôs birthday.  The expectation for Elyse is to give me some gift on behalf of our 2 children.  The truth is, this weekend is a celebration of the gifts we have already received.</p>

<p>Being between jobs, I spend a lot of time trying to keep myself busy during the day.  I tend to do a lot of chores and small projects that have gone neglected.  Over the last 2 months, the small projects have led several afternoon shopping runs.  During my shopping runs, I tend to swing through the toy section and see about something small for the kids.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, Barbie dominated the toy section.  In a normal department store, Barbie controlled about an aisle and half.  And in a toy store, whether it was Toys R Us, Circus World, Child‚Äôs World, or Kay-Bee, Barbie owned the girls‚Äô section.</p>

<p><strong>** UPDATED 03/18/2014 8:18AM PDT **</strong></p>
<p>I thought that I had written all that needed to be said about the decietful, misogynist, forced-birth advocating, so called &ldquo;secular pro life&rdquo; movement <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/00761_anti-choice-anti-woman-and-anti-honesty-atheists/" >two years ago</a>
 . I didn&rsquo;t realize then that the current mostly-male &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; of the secular movement was composed almost entirely of misogynists, abusers, liars, and morally-bankrupt cowards. Those who are not anti-woman seem to be so obsessed with courting &ldquo;allies&rdquo; that they have no problems throwing women under the bus to advance their petty agendas.</p>

<p>There is an event happening in Ohio on November 2nd that might shock and surprise you for many reasons. It&rsquo;s an event to celebrate&amp; &amp; <em>D√≠a de Muertos</em>, the Mexican holiday to commemorate and celebrate reflect upon your dead ancestors and loved ones, with a BDSM play party. We&rsquo;re grown ups and we know people have sex and even have kinky sex in groups. The part that may be a shock for some is that the organizer of the event is a self-described &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; educator. That&rsquo;s right: this crass event of cultural appropriation, where a holiday for remembering your dead friends and family is being used as exotic set dressing for an orgy is being organized by someone who thinks they are <em>helping</em> fight racism. But if you&rsquo;re surprised, it probably because you&rsquo;re white. Why do I feel comfortable making an assumption like that? Because of how privilege works.</p>

<p>Dear Mr Zuckerberg,</p>
<p>It must be pretty awesome to be a white dude with billions of dollars. It must be nice to be able to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2051201/Facebook-founder-Mark-Zuckerberg-gets-bodyguard.html" target="_blank" >afford peace of mind</a>
 . You do realize that not everyone is a billionaire right? Because when <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/News/735/Reminder-Finishing-the-Removal-of-an-Old-Search-Setting" target="_blank" >Facebook makes decisions to allow any timeline to be found by name alone</a>
  that&rsquo;s seriously messed up. Your suggestions to make things more secure are laughable:</p>

<p>From one cis hetero white man to another: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>I realize none of this is likely to make much of a difference to you, because you&rsquo;re not about accountability or criticism. No, not you Hugo. But you&rsquo;re hurting people. You are being an abuser. You are verbally abusing women of color, and then you apologize and cry about your mental illness and &ldquo;go away&rdquo;&hellip;but you come back. I think you will always come back so long as you feel like you can get away with it. Because I think you like to feel important. It seems that negative attention is almost as good as positive for you, and maybe there&rsquo;s that inner abuser that&rsquo;s really the core of who you are Hugo. Maybe the &ldquo;real&rsquo;&rdquo; Hugo isn&rsquo;t the man who writes about consent, but is instead the man who tried to kill his girlfriend. I think maybe that is the real you. I think maybe you used your mainstream white handsomeness and your abuser&rsquo;s facility at bullshit to talk your way into spaces where you could victimize on a grand scale.</p>
