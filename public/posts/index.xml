      <description>Person 1: You‚Äôre the one that has a problem w/ a safety tool available to women. Or are you one of the ‚Äúteach men not to rape‚Äù girls?! Person 2: god forbid anyone teach men not to rape! üòê Person 1: You truly believe #rape is taught/untaught?! It isn‚Äôt! That suggests EVERY man is a potential rapist!
I saw the conversation to the left on Twitter tonight and it made me angry.</description>

      <description>This weekend is a special weekend for me. On Saturday, I will celebrate 11 years of marriage with my brilliant, amazing, strong and determined wife, Elyse. And on Sunday, we will celebrate Elyse‚Äôs birthday, and Father‚Äôs Day.
This weekend, in many ways, is a celebration of my life. The beauty of this weekend is I can share it with those I love most. And while the commercial world says I need to go out and buy something made of steel for our anniversary, and buy some trinket or some other gift for Elyse‚Äôs birthday.</description>

      <description>Being between jobs, I spend a lot of time trying to keep myself busy during the day. I tend to do a lot of chores and small projects that have gone neglected. Over the last 2 months, the small projects have led several afternoon shopping runs. During my shopping runs, I tend to swing through the toy section and see about something small for the kids.
When I was a kid, Barbie dominated the toy section.</description>

      <title>A statement on women&#39;s bodily autonomy and the morally bankrupt cowards who consider it up for debate.</title>

      <description>__** UPDATED 03/18/2014 8:18AM PDT **__
I thought that I had written all that needed to be said about the decietful, misogynist, forced-birth advocating, so called &amp;ldquo;secular pro life&amp;rdquo; movement two years ago. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize then that the current mostly-male &amp;ldquo;leadership&amp;rdquo; of the secular movement was composed almost entirely of misogynists, abusers, liars, and morally-bankrupt cowards. Those who are not anti-woman seem to be so obsessed with courting &amp;ldquo;allies&amp;rdquo; that they have no problems throwing women under the bus to advance their petty agendas.</description>

      <description>I have supported and also criticized American Atheists over the years. Today I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated and am offering some criticism. Criticism that I hope is listened too. I&amp;rsquo;m an atheist and I want atheist organizations to prosper, but I also want them to reflect my values.
Today AA issues a new press release&amp;amp; announcing six new billboards.
 American Atheists launched six billboards on Monday in central New Jersey attacking the non-helpful responses by some religions to recent natural disasters.</description>

      <description>There is an event happening in Ohio on November 2nd that might shock and surprise you for many reasons. It&amp;rsquo;s an event to celebrate&amp;amp; &amp;amp; D√≠a de Muertos, the Mexican holiday to commemorate and celebrate reflect upon your dead ancestors and loved ones, with a BDSM play party. We&amp;rsquo;re grown ups and we know people have sex and even have kinky sex in groups. The part that may be a shock for some is that the organizer of the event is a self-described &amp;ldquo;diversity&amp;rdquo; educator.</description>

      <description>Dear Mr Zuckerberg,
It must be pretty awesome to be a white dude with billions of dollars. It must be nice to be able to afford peace of mind. You do realize that not everyone is a billionaire right? Because when Facebook makes decisions to allow any timeline to be found by name alone that&amp;rsquo;s seriously messed up. Your suggestions to make things more secure are laughable:
   Share each post with the people you want to be able to see it.</description>

From one cis hetero white man to another: Shut the fuck up.
I realize none of this is likely to make much of a difference to you, because you&amp;rsquo;re not about accountability or criticism. No, not you Hugo. But you&amp;rsquo;re hurting people. You are being an abuser. You are verbally abusing women of color, and then you apologize and cry about your mental illness and &amp;ldquo;go away&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;but you come back.</description>

      <description>Cassidy Lynn Campbell, the first openly transgender woman to be crowned prom queen, can&amp;rsquo;t have one day in her life to treasure. If she has to suffer this way, then you do too. Watch it and weep. AND THEN GET THE FUCK UP OFF YOUR ASS AND DO SOMETHING TO MAKE THE WORLD SAFE FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE.

      <description>‚ÄúDo you remember what I did to you last night?‚Äù
That‚Äôs what he asked when I woke, as if asking me to go to breakfast.
I kind of remembered. Then I turned over and felt the pain. He got me drunk, he drugged me, and he fucked me up the ass. I went home with him willingly; I had the hots for him and hoped to play around. But I did-not-would-not-would-never consent to a virtual stranger fucking me.</description>

      <description>Everyone is piling on Miley Cyrus for her performance at the Mtv VMAs last night. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen her called &amp;ldquo;skank&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;attention whore&amp;rdquo;, her body being criticized as unwomanly and undesireable, and even someone saying she &amp;ldquo;covered herself in STDs and crack&amp;rdquo;. Others have talked about Robin Thicke and criticized the appropriateness of a married 36 year old dancing in a sexually suggestive way with a 20 year old women. All of those are stupid things to talk about.</description>

      <description>[Updates below]
If you didn&amp;rsquo;t already know,National Public Radio told the New York Times:
 National Public Radio will continue for now to refer to Private Manning as ‚Äúhe,‚Äù according to a spokeswoman, Anna Bross. ‚ÄúUntil Bradley Manning‚Äôs desire to have his gender changed actually physically happens, we will be using male-related pronouns to identify him,‚Äù she said.
 So I told them this:
 Dear Vermont Public Radio,
I hate having to write this letter.</description>

      <description>I have wanted to talk about something for years and I think maybe now is the right time to talk about it. I want to show my support for both Karen Stollznow* and Carrie Poppy by sharing my own rather unpleasant experiences with DJ Grothe. I want to show that their experiences are not isolated incidents. They are part of a larger picture and are important.
It&amp;rsquo;s sort of known among certain people in the skepticoatheirationalist sphere that DJ Grothe is not terribly fond of me.</description>

      <description>There‚Äôs a special place in my imaginary hell for tepid bystanders who turn a blind eye to the suffering and targeting of someone more vulnerable. I hate them, and I hate them more than I hate the tormentors. Because they fly a false flag. They present themselves as friends but turn out to be collaborators at the most dire moments. Because they know better and they choose to do nothing. To do nothing in a way that magnifies the stage, and scope, and power of bullies.</description>

      <description>So I just discovered there was a backlog of comments on the site (and pertaining to my post). I&amp;rsquo;m still learning the administration side, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t even see them before today. No censorship involved (although I totally will), so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to find something else to fap about.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs hard work bruising egos, even if you‚Äôre as professionally competent as Sasha and Carl. Sometimes you need a SpokesGay. That sometimes is now.
Welcome, me!
Now. Let‚Äôs get right to the pissing-off-of-gay-doodz. Mainly white gay doodz. Before you wrap your peaches in freezer paper, though, understand this: All the things I list below I‚Äôve been guilty of. Every one of us ambles about in an oblivion bubble about something(s). It‚Äôs part of the human condition.</description>

      <description>As an ally, my words are likely to be given more ‚Äúweight‚Äù in a discussion by many people. There are a lot of reasons for this. The main reason is that I have a lot of social privilege as a straight, white, able-bodied, cis man. I‚Äôm someone who is at the top of a lot of oppression hierarchies. Another reason is that people have this idea of ‚Äúobjectivity‚Äù that is just plain wrong, because no one is objective.</description>

      <description>I was at the Center for Inquiry&amp;rsquo;s second Women in Secularism conference last month. It was one of the best secular conferences I have ever attended and I hope there is another one next year. The staff, especially Melody Hensley did a remarkable job and I applaud them.
There were two dark clouds at the conference that dampened many people&amp;rsquo;s enjoyment. One was a notorious part time &amp;ldquo;activist&amp;rdquo; and full time attention seeker who attended the conference in order to taunt feminists and report back to his vile, hateful, and dangerous friends at A Voice for Men.</description>

      <description>To put it in skeptic terms, #ShutUpAndListen means &amp;ldquo;You lack evidence relevant to this problem, so learn from those who have it.&amp;quot;
So first off let&amp;rsquo;s address the elephant in the room. I simply cannot add anything to discussion of Ron Lindsay&amp;rsquo;s opening remarks that holds a candle to what&amp;rsquo;s been said by Secular Women, Dan Fincke, Adam Lee and a whole host of other people. I&amp;rsquo;m not even going to try because the more I think about it the more irritated I become about Dr.</description>

      <description>But why don&amp;rsquo;t they turn on the barbarians and stop them?
Yesterday Richard Dawkins continued his recent campaign of xenophobia on Twitter with the following:
 Of COURSE most Muslims are decent people. But why don&amp;rsquo;t they turn on the barbarians and stop them? ‚Äî Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) March 10, 2013
 It seems like such a simple question, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? I assume Richard Dawkins thinks of himself as a decent person, as most atheists (OF COURSE) are, but why then does he not turn on the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and ableist &amp;ldquo;barbarians&amp;rdquo; in our midst?</description>

      <description>A friend posted a link to this article on Slate about a married man with no kids who is a homemaker. I loved the article. Due, in no small part, to the fact that this very well could have been how my life ended up. At one point in my life I was a physics major dating a chemical engineer - pretty clear who was going to be earning the big bucks there.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running More Than Men for a year now (even longer if you count the pre-launch preparation we did) and I&amp;rsquo;m more proud than you can know of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and the response we&amp;rsquo;ve generated &amp;ndash; even the backlash from anti-feminists makes me proud. Unfortunately I need to step away for a few month to take care of some personal affairs. It breaks my heart to do so but I can&amp;rsquo;t keep doing this and also keep doing the things I need to do in my private life and be successful at either.</description>

      <description>Over on Twitter the always fantastic Natalie Reed made a point about something that has been stewing in the back of my head for a while. Thanks to her I now know what to say. I made a handy Storify compilation for you to see what she had to say, below the cut.

Well, it turns out that 4 of the city supervisors thing it&amp;rsquo;s super cool to have an admitted domestic abuser serving as the city&amp;rsquo;s top law enforcement official&amp;hellip;while on probation.</description>

      <description>Last night the Republican party was able to share with us all an important lesson: In the modern world alienating women, people with disabilities, and racial &amp;amp; sexual minorities is a losing proposition. Even Republicans are admitting that this is not our parents‚Äô America.
The Republican Rape Squad of Mourdock and Akin were resoundingly defeated, despite running in fairly conservative districts. Marriage equality won big. Women in elected office are now at historic highs in the face of sexist antagonism and antipathy from the Republican party.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a week since Justin Vacula resigned from his leadership position with the Secular Coalition for America, but people are still talking about it. I supported, and signed the petition asking for him to be removed. Vacula resigned without any need for the SCA to act. That&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m here for today.
I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a recurring meme from Vacula&amp;rsquo;s defenders and from those who are &amp;ldquo;trying to be neutral.</description>

      <description>Juana In√©s de la Cruz was a self-taught scholar , scientist, and poet - and later a nun - in Mexico during the 17th century. You&amp;rsquo;re learning about her because I recently read one of her poems that proves that Nice Guys and slut shaming are nothing new.
si con ansia sin igual solicit√°is su desd√©n, ¬øpor qu√© quereis que obren bien si las incit√°is al mal?
Combat√≠s su resistencia y luego, con gravedad, dec√≠s que fue liviandad lo que hizo la diligencia.</description>

      <description>This year I was really bummed to be unable to attend Melody Hensley&amp;rsquo;s fantastic, important, and much needed Women in Secularism conference. I was thrilled to learn that there would be a second one and even more thrilled when I saw the fantastic lineup of speakers Melody has recruited. I will be there in May 2013 and you should be, too &amp;ndash; especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a dude.
Religion and the cultural we share with the religious has a unique and problematic relationship with women.</description>

      <description>This is actually a PSA for guys in general, but it was heavily inspired by my reflections of Dragon*Con and things I observed there thus the title. It‚Äôs also inspired by other stories I‚Äôve heard and read recently, like this one.
I know the following is not meant for most of the people who read my blog (all 3 of you) or most people in general but I‚Äôve recently observed this first hand and it made me angry, so I felt the need to write about it.</description>

      <description>(This post is actually part of my homework in Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies this week. I hope I get a good grade.)
How to convince men to be allies to women is something I have been trying to master for more than a year now, most actively since I started my blogging project with the new year. It‚Äôs honestly not an easy task. The biggest response I get is a lot of apathy from other men, and then I get the occasional outright enmity from some die-hards I can only call misogynists.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but sometimes caring publicly about equality and making a point of being visibly not-horrible can sometimes be exhausting and demoralizing. The relentless and obsessive attacks on people, especially women, who speak out against misogyny and hate really fuck with my head. I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with depression my whole life and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty triggering for me. Many is the evening or weekend I spend holed-up at home because I&amp;rsquo;m just sick of the world and everyone in it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m borrowing my title from Joanna Russ&amp;rsquo;s 1982 skewering of the ways that women and minorities are prevented from having a written voice. In the book Russ examines 11 ways the writing of women is suppressed:
 Prohibitions Bad Faith Denial of Agency Pollution of Agency The Double Standard of Content False Categorizing Isolation Anomalousness Lack of Models Responses Aesthetics  I&amp;rsquo;d like to propose a 12th method for our new internet age: Call her names and relentlessly stalk her online until she can&amp;rsquo;t take it any more.</description>

      <description>Everyone&amp;rsquo;s talking about Atheism Plus, new-new-atheism, social justice atheism, whatever you feel like calling it. I already sharedthe thoughts I had been having along those lines, and now I want to really get in to where I stand on things.
I support Atheism Plus, at least in so far as I support atheists caring about social justice and equality. If I could be said that I have any reservations or concerns about this new &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo; it is that apathy will eventually lead to it being a bunch of relatively privileged people paying lip service to social justice and equality, but not really doing much about it.</description>

Typically we find this &amp;ldquo;gem&amp;rdquo; of advice applying to an individual&amp;rsquo;s approach to an important meeting of some sort or even daily life. However, as a &amp;ldquo;First TAMmer&amp;rdquo;, I had the opportunity to do a little role reversal and get a true first impression from the active skeptic community at TAM2012.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a skeptic for a long while, but never really considered seeking out or joining any skeptic community.</description>

      <description>For those who have been fortunate enough to escape biotruth logic, I&amp;rsquo;ll start by giving a brief summation of the kinds of arguments that fall into that abyss. When it comes to discussions about gender, they take the following form explicitly, but there is always an implicit context to these arguments (which I will include in brackets as part of the quote):
&amp;ldquo;Men are x, women are y. That&amp;rsquo;s just how humans are; it&amp;rsquo;s biology.</description>

      <description>For some, skeptical atheism took a turn for the revolutionary this weekend. There‚Äôs a mood in the air that had me write an earlier draft of this post. Then Jen McCreight beat me to it with her brilliant post calling for a new wave of atheism. Ophelia Benson, Jason Thibaeult, and Greta Christina soon blogged their support. Jen followed up with a crowd sourced name for this new wave and a report that grassroots support is, at the moment, growing.</description>

      <guid>https://morethanmen.org/posts/01340_patriarchs/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;Patriarchy&amp;rdquo; is a term that is often thrown around in feminist circles. Loosely speaking, it symbolizes the claim that we live in a male dominated society that condescends, controls, and diminishes women. This is a central tenet of feminism, but is a bit hard to swallow to the uninitiated because it makes it sound like there is some ominous, seemingly-conspiratorial group of men that sits in the upper echelons of society that enacts an anti-woman agenda.</description>

What I find really interesting, and telling, and instructive here is that the picture is obviously intended to cause offense and outrage in the targeted people, Ms. Watson and PZ Myers. In the image, calculated for outrage, he accuses his victims of profitting from &amp;ldquo;manufactured outrage&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Here in San Francisco domestic violence has been in the news for all of 2012. The abuser just happens to be our sheriff. I&amp;rsquo;m bringing it up because it&amp;rsquo;s a public case that documents many of the strategies employed by misogynist shitlords when they&amp;rsquo;re confronted by distaste from decent people.
Ross Mirkarimi was elected sheriff of the city and county of San Francisco in November of 2011. Over New Year&amp;rsquo;s Mirkarimi and his wife Eliana Lopez got into an argument that became physical.</description>

I recently spent almost a whole day reading that now infamous Reddit thread [serious trigger warnings for all sorts of awfulness] inviting sexual abusers and rapists to tell their side the story. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to read it at first. I read the articles about it. I circled it&amp;hellip;and then like probing an open wound I kept worrying at it. I wanted to understand why.</description>

      <description>There‚Äôs been a lot of talk posted recently about sexual harassment policies, rape jokes, and the like. Somehow people have developed the idea that complaining about harassment is the root problem, and that it‚Äôs ok to make jokes about sexual assault. The handful of people who have spoken out against these ideas have been attacked and threatened online. Perhaps this is a general symptom of the internet‚Äôs distance and relative anonymity, but I see it as something far worse: a pervasive idea that sexual assault is a women‚Äôs problem, and they should deal with it silently and in private.</description>

She provided some examples of the stuff out there being directed at feminist women, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty despicable. I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you reading this have seen it&amp;rsquo;s like before and have asked yourself&amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;What can I do?&amp;rdquo; The answer is alarmingly simple. You can speak out.</description>

      <description>Because of my name and the poor reading comprehension of most misogynists I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten one rape threat while writing about feminism. That&amp;rsquo;s nothing compared to what women get. The way society tries to silence women is appalling and well documented. It really turns the stomach of anyone with a trace of humanity. Society has other, gentler, ways of silencing and dismissing feminist men, though. I want to talk about those today, not to climb on a cross or to equate what male feminists like me experience to what women encounter, but to show men that they&amp;rsquo;re not alone when these things get hurled at them.</description>

      <description>When Elevatorgate blew up, I didn&amp;rsquo;t get it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that I was firmly in the camp of sexism deniers, but I argued a lot of irrelevent, tangential ideas and failed to understand the central objection that was being raised. I orbited around the issue for a long time before things really started to click into place, and even now I know I have some hard, mental work left to do.</description>

 Stop writing about or investigating ghosts and cryptozoology at home. Don&amp;rsquo;t you know there are people being killed as witches in Africa?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m tired of calling the discussion about sexism within the skeptic and atheist movements a &amp;ldquo;controversy&amp;rdquo;. As I see it, what myself and others who talk about the fact that our communities are as subject to sexism (and racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc) as the rest of society are encountering is denialism. Look, we know that skeptics and atheists aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect. Aspiring to an ideal of rationality and fairness doesn&amp;rsquo;t make us perfect, it just means we&amp;rsquo;re trying to be better.</description>

The panel consisted of a number of prominent female skeptics (Rebecca Watson, Cristina Rad, Stephanie Zvan, and Heina Dadabhoy) along with a couple of male colleagues (Greg Laden and Jason Thibeault) discussing the issues of gender attitudes, sexism, and misogyny in the skeptical movement.</description>

First you have the &amp;ldquo;science comedians&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;atheist comedians&amp;rdquo; who have tepid, hacky jokes pandering the the interests and opinions of skeptics and atheists.

      <description>Their main argument, as far as I can tell in between the derailing, namecalling, Godwinning, and other extreme ridiculousness is that it&amp;rsquo;s unnecessary and punitive to have a freedom-crippling set of rules governing how people treat each other. They seem to be saying that decent people are decent and most people are decent and anyway those online rape threats are just weirdos who never go anywhere and anyway they never saw anyone being sexually harassed at a conference.</description>

      <description>We atheists know that creationism relies on bad logic and laughable arguments. Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s super interesting (though not at all surprising): anti-feminist creationists and anti-feminist atheists use the same shitty logic and laughable arguments when it comes to crapping on women!
Over the on Uncommon Descent - a site &amp;ldquo;serving the intelligent design community - someone going by &amp;ldquo;scordova&amp;rdquo; tries to beat up on Rebecca Watson using basically the same ridiculous nonsense reactionary and hateful atheists have been using to try and pillory her about being a woman for years.</description>

      <description>MRAs, anti-feminists, and general dudebros are fond of responding to feminists and just-not-horrible people (especially women) by whining making strongly worded claims of misandry. Inspired by the amazing How To Be A Reverse-Racist: An Actual Step by Step List For Oppressing White People by A. D. Song and Mia McKenzie I‚Äôve created this handy guide to using the inherently unfair (to men) system to create a gynocratic fempire that I would like to call Misandria.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a guest post from Huey P. Newton, one of the co-founders of the Black Panther Party. I love, love, love this piece because it represents exactly the kind of self-reflection that inspired me and that we hope to inspire here at More Than Men. This is the entire text of a speech Newton delivered on August 15, 1970. Enjoy. - Sasha
During the past few years strong movements have developed among women and among homosexuals seeking their liberation.</description>

      <description>Those of us who argue for diversity are prone to empathy. We not only see that our position is logical and reasonable, but we are passionate about it. We feel about these things very strongly. These issues matter to us very much. It‚Äôs why we‚Äôre so prone to burnout. We pour are hearts into this and it hurts us when we‚Äôre attacked about these things. Since More Than Men started at the beginning of the year I have felt used up and beat up and emotionally exhausted several times, and I don‚Äôt even get the worst sort of abuse.</description>

      <description>As an organizer for my local Skeptic group, it was important to me to include an anti-harassment policy. My co-organizer and I very much wanted the gender ratio to be as close to 50/50 as it could be, for both speakers and attendees. To that end I wanted a good anti-harassment policy in place. I never imagined that it would be an issue. I guess at heart I&amp;rsquo;ve been far too much of an optimist.</description>

      <description>Saladin Ahmed is a Muslim, Arab-American fantasy writer. (If you enjoy fantastic fiction, I recommend his novel [Throne of the Crescent Moon[(https://www.amazon.com/Throne-Crescent-Moon-Kingdoms/dp/0756407117/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1)].) As you‚Äôd expect he‚Äôs experienced some racism and religious bigotry directed at he and his family, especially since 2001. Last August he was asked if that hate was something he had experienced in the publishing trade, to which he replied:
 &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;talking about this or that sector of society as being less or more racist is kind of like talking about this or that part of the ocean being less or more wet.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re still working on building our list of secular/skeptical/science events with harassment policies. It&amp;rsquo;s grown some since we started, but we need your help. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know about the policy, please comment here with the name of an event you attend or organize and, ideally, a link to their webpage. I&amp;rsquo;ll do the work of tracking down a policy they may have that we can&amp;rsquo;t find.
I think this is a non-controversial but important step.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm a big fan of the Secular Student Alliance. For more than a decade they have been helping secular students organize for mutual support and activism. They provide resources to students, educators, and alumni to make schools safer and more welcoming for secularists. They are a true grass roots organization that is training and empowering the next generation of secular leaders and thinkers. They are also more diverse than most secular groups with older memberships.</description>

      <description>As I wrote on Wednesday, I don‚Äôt see how there is anything controversial about events having or enforcing policies about harassment. We‚Äôve even started building a list of existing harassment policies at conferences as a resource for event organizers, attendees, and speakers. Unfortunately it does seem like a lot of people do think these policies are a bad idea for our events.
One reason I&amp;rsquo;ve seen given in opposition to harassment policies is that they are prudish and they inhibit the ability for adults to express their sexuality.</description>

      <description>When asked what to do to make skeptic and atheist events feel more safe for women attendees and speakers, Stephanie Zvan blogged about a pretty simple thing to do: institute, publicize, and enforce anti-harassment policies. This is such an obvious step that I&amp;rsquo;m surprised every event doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clear policy in place. While there are some wild-eyed contrarians (and possible assholes) who think that harassment policies are oppressive and horrible, most people seem to agree that they&amp;rsquo;re a good idea and Stephanie&amp;rsquo;s post is making some real progress.</description>

      <description>In Wednesday‚Äôs post I implied that a lot of people think that combating sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, and ableism are too political and are not really something that skeptics should be worried about. Obviously I disagree but there are well known skeptic speakers who definitely think that those are not a part of ‚Äúscientific skepticism‚Äù and we should instead only talk about ghost lights, psychics, and how stupid Catholics are. The idea seems to be that there was a ‚Äúskeptical canon‚Äù established some time in the mid-20th century and that if we apply skepticism outside that we‚Äôre doing skepticism wrong or are ‚Äúbeing political‚Äù and not rational.</description>

Some people have said that when I see warning signs for misogyny I‚Äôm really just being mean and hateful to people with old fashioned values. I would argue that in many cases ‚Äúold fashioned values‚Äù are misogynist, racist, and homophobic, but apparently some disagree.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a single guy who uses OkCupid to meet people, occasionally to hilarious effect. I also have a lot of women friends who date online and run in to guys who are pretty horrible. It also turns out that not everyone, male or female, is super skilled at spotting misogyny warning signs. That got me thinking ,which now got you this post.
A lot of these might seem really obvious, but in my experience these red flags are sometimes missed because when we&amp;rsquo;re looking for romance or sex online we&amp;rsquo;re often trying to see the best in people because we know that expressing yourself through a profile can be hard.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm gonna let you guys in on a little secret today: science isn‚Äôt cheap. There‚Äôs a lot of fundraising that goes on to support the research which leads to the treatments that make life on planet earth longer and better. Unfortunately not everything gets the financial backing that it deserves.
What causes do and don&amp;rsquo;t get funded? Well, it isn&amp;rsquo;t always as impartial as you&amp;rsquo;d hope. Helping men past their prime get it up obviously isn&amp;rsquo;t a very pressing concern, but the prevalence of 80 year olds with limp dicks and disposable income prompted the creation of Viagra over treatments for say&amp;hellip; for Sickle Cell Anemia, which is actually life threatening (unlike erectile dysfunction) but tends to effect minority populations disproportionately.</description>

  Then someone replied that they&amp;rsquo;d like to see the video about things men actually say to men who say shit to women on the street. They had a real point.

The skeptic an atheist communities have a &amp;ldquo;big tent&amp;rdquo; that celebrates misogynists that deny the scientific facts of climate change and rewards misogynists that promote dangerous anti-vaccination nonsense but when we talk about how our movements can and should address and support issues unique to women, racial minorities, and the disabled, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans community we are told we&amp;rsquo;re reaching too far and are out of line.</description>

This has got me thinking about skeptic and atheist conferences. What are they for? I&amp;rsquo;m going to let you in on a secret: When I go to conferences and cons (even science fiction and gaming cons) I almost never go to any programming.</description>

      <description>[This originally appeared on Anthroslug&amp;rsquo;s personal blog on April 2, 2012.]
I loathe the term ‚Äúthe Friend Zone.‚Äù It is one of those terms that seems to get thrown around without much thought, generally by men as an excuse for why they have had little success with dating and/or sex. My dislike for this term comes from my often-stated dislike for sloppy thinking and irrational claims, and as such I am not going to get into a discussion of whether or not the idea of the Friend Zone is born out of issues pertaining to privilege or misogyny (besides, [more articulate individuals than myself have already done so]](https://morethanmen.</description>

      <description>There is a debate within feminism about men. That debate is whether a man can really call himself a feminist. Some argue that since men have privilege that women do not have we cannot really understand the lives of women and therefore can be pro-feminist nit not actually be called feminists. Others say that this is limiting and is in it‚Äôs own way sexist, creating a women-only club that needlessly excludes male allies.</description>

      <description>I think by now you‚Äôd have to have been living in a rather deep, dark hole to not have heard at least something about the sad case of Trayvon Martin‚Äôs death at the hands of George Zimmerman. Rather than rehash a lot of what has been hashed out and speculated upon ad nauseam regarding the case, I would like to speak to what I see as some broader questions.
First, I will say that the purpose of this blog post is not to make an argument for the guilt or innocence of George Zimmerman, nor will I speculate on whether or not Trayvon Martin instigated the encounter, nor will I go into the question of whether or not so-called ‚Äústand your ground‚Äù laws are a good idea.</description>

      <description>Good, it‚Äôs Friday. I‚Äôve written before about microaggressions, those tiny, maybe apparently innocuous phrases, questions or comments that make us feel excluded, insulted, or objectified. I had one of those happened to me yesterday. Remember how Wednesday I wrote about my body and how my deviation from our cultural ‚Äúnorm‚Äù sometimes makes people feel entitled to treat me as an object? The very next day I was riding my train home from work.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s probably too late for you this year, but next year you should consider going to FOGcon here in the San Francisco Bay Area. I&amp;rsquo;ll buy you a drink.
Anyhow, FOGcon has a clearly articulated and posted policy on harassment. This is something many conventions and conferences do. TAM has one as well, but there was a bit of a furor over it, including talk of boycotting the event.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Jason Thibeault, no stranger to these parts, wrote a great summary of the recent fight to get trans rights legislation passed in Canada. Basically, no one at all is taking the bill seriously. What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that while the petition to get the MPs and media to take notice is languishing in obscurity there is another petition protesting a trans woman being kicked out of a beauty pageant. The petition to get trans people the rights they deserve and need is being mostly ignored while the petition to protest a cis-normative appearing trans woman being excluded from a venue for objectifying women is crazy popular, guys.</description>

We are men after all, and we find women attractive, and have an urge to look at them. So, why not? It‚Äôs a powerful urge anyway. It‚Äôs almost impossible to resist.</description>

Though he says his friend at the Cato institute coined the word, ‚Äúfeminazi‚Äù sure has caught on over the last 20 years. ‚ÄúFeminazi‚Äù is, of course a ridiculous auto-Godwinning slur to throw around but it represents something much more widespread: the fact that the straw feminist is what so many people see as the ‚Äúreal‚Äù feminist.
It&amp;rsquo;s an old joke that anything someone says that follows &amp;quot; I&amp;rsquo;m not a racist, but&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; is always going to be horribly racist.</description>

      <description>On Friday there was a bit of a kerfuffle about a new billboard from American Atheists, Inc. The billboard is a response to Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s stupid new &amp;ldquo;Year of the Bible&amp;rdquo; as designated by the state legislature. I think most atheists, non-believers, and secularists see the problem with the government decreeing any year a year for Biblical thinking and study - that pesky 1st Amendment we all love. The problem many people had is the imagery and message used in the ad.</description>

      <description>Something that Natalie Reed touched on, is the fact that straight, white, cis men are seen as the ‚Äú[default]‚Äú(https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial). This cultural message leads some male skeptics, who should really know better, to have internalized an idea that minorities have biases (because, obviously, they‚Äôre different!) and they do not. I think this is the biggest factor leading to what‚Äôs come to be called ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äú. (When you think about it, ‚Äú[mansplaining]‚Äù(https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mansplain) is not much different from what many skeptics and atheists do all the time when talk to theists, climate change deniers, creationists, anti-vaxers, etc.</description>

      <description>I despair and come close to just saying &amp;ldquo;fuck it&amp;rdquo; and abandoning my participation in the skeptic and atheist communities on at least a weekly basis because of how often I see unconscionable behavior not only happen but being defended by man, and in some cases at least tolerated by very prominent leaders in our community. Sam Harris has famously argued that &amp;ldquo;moderate&amp;rdquo;, liberal theists provide cover for religious extremists. I see the same thing happening here.</description>

      <description>From the start there has been a lot of internal and external discussion of whether or not a project like More Than Men with it&amp;rsquo;s country-club style membership can really serve a purpose in the movement for greater equality and diversity. Obviously I think it can, if only because there are some people who are receptive to the message but because of how society trains them they have a harder time hearing and understanding a minority voice.</description>

      <description>That‚Äôs just not true. I‚Äôm going to admit something right now. I‚Äôm a straight, white guy with a middle-class upbringing. I am also, irrevocably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and probably a host of other -ists and -phobics that you can toss at me. I‚Äôm like this because I‚Äôm a product of a society that is also racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and all the others. I‚Äôve been taught a certain view of normalcy, and as a result, I act with mannerisms that reflect this certain view.</description>

      <description>Something lighter today. My good friend and my favorite comedian Matt Gubser gives his take on the questions I asked on Friday. This is him working on his bit before it&amp;rsquo;s completely finished, so he&amp;rsquo;s asked that you not judge him by it. I think it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious, though.(Video is NSFW due to some salty language.)</description>

      <description>Bullshit.
First off, we all have stories about that atheist who is not a critical thinker. My own is a guy who laughed at Christianity because their sole evidence was a book that is a few thousand years old. In the next breath he sang the praises of traditional Chinese magical ground-up penis herbal medicine, because it&amp;rsquo;s been practiced for thousands of years. In other words what was laughable as evidence for Christianity was compelling evidence for something that appealed to him.</description>

      <description>Is there a difference, as some have told me there is, between saying a woman &amp;ldquo;dresses like a slut&amp;rdquo; and calling her a slut?
Is there a difference between calling a man a whore and calling a woman a whore? Please explain why you think so.
Are women responsible for the sexual behavior of men around them if they dress a certain way? Where does that line get drawn? What does that say about men and their agency as humans?</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: unless you start being an asshole I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to make you feel like a crappy person. We&amp;rsquo;re all forced into this system and we have to reason our way out of it. Just like many of us reject the &amp;ldquo;common sense&amp;rdquo; arguments for religious belief and then we ask questions and gather information and draw a conclusion. Your average theist isn&amp;rsquo;t stupid or evil, they just haven&amp;rsquo;t done the work or had that &amp;ldquo;deconversion&amp;rdquo; moment.</description>

      <description>A reader hipped me to a video recently. I watched it. I can see the appeal, since it&amp;rsquo;s a video all about being awesomer to people. Something about it didn&amp;rsquo;t sit right with me, though. Here, you watch and then we&amp;rsquo;ll get back together after the jump and compare notes.
  Okay, so, yes, it&amp;rsquo;s not nice to call people homophobic names. It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you more straight to do so.</description>

You‚Äôll generally see it used in one of two ways: as self-identification by people who consider themselves feminists, and as a pejorative by people who do not.
It‚Äôs a word with an ugly connotation in many people‚Äôs minds, not unlike the word ‚Äúatheist‚Äù; people hear the ‚Äú-ist‚Äù suffix and infer an ideology that seeks feminine supremacy rather than gender equality, just as many see atheism as a rebellious denial of God rather than an affirmative acceptance of a godless universe.</description>

      <description>Like many within the skeptical community, I have been reading with interest the recent discussion which has been waged (or, should I say, raged?) on the topic of diversity within the skeptical movement. Apparently, it all goes back to this article ‚Äì Why White Men Should Refuse to be on Panels of All White Men ‚Äì which led to this blog post over at Skepchick. It also seems that there is a bit of a ‚Äústorm‚Äù of controversy swirling as a result of the discussion generated by these articles.</description>

      <description>Well, the truth is there is a long history of secularism and humanism in the African-American community and it&amp;rsquo;s long past time that the rest of us took notice. There&amp;rsquo;s also a way we can help the growing numbers of atheists and free-thinkers of color. It&amp;rsquo;s call the Day of Solidarity for Black Non-Believers and I encourage you to help spread the word.
That last link was to a brand new site, African-Americans for Humanism, and it&amp;rsquo;s one I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Just read your guide to not being a misogynist. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in your views on privilege from here in England. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how hot you are at proclaiming white, male, heterosexual males to be privileged.
&amp;ldquo;I agree to a certain extent, but domestically I feel that class, socio-economic, health and educational attainment are just as important. Therefore, in your mind I&amp;rsquo;m possibly one of those males who you may consider &amp;lsquo;just don&amp;rsquo;t get it&amp;rsquo;.</description>

As someone who helps organize a skeptical conference in Northern California I found myself thinking how event organizers can take some extra steps to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on hearing any worthy voices in our cause. I asked for some input from skeptics and atheists with disabilities and have a few ideas myself.</description>

First, some background It seems the whole thing got started when Rebecca Watson of Skepchick wrote about an encounter she had with a man in an elevator in Dublin. Long story short: the guy propositioned her, and she said no; she also felt somewhat cornered seeing as how she was stuck, alone, in a metal cage with the guy. Apparently, there were a number of people who thought she handled the situation poorly (especially by blogging about it and noting the inappropriate behavior on the part of the man in question).</description>

The sheer amount of bigotry, hatred, and blind, unthinking idiocy on display by citizens of Cranston is astonishing, made no less so by their calls for religious tolerance.

 Women are nice to look at.

  &amp;ldquo;As written, the law would require women seeking an abortion in Texas to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure.</description>

      <description>[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_469&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;alignleft&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;240&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;ldquo;Diversity makes many things easier.&amp;quot;] One of the most often cited ways to encourage diversity within our communities is to promote diversity amongst the speakers we feature at our events. There has been a lot of high-profile success in this - TAM has been approaching 50/50 gender representation, for instance - but there still seem to be a lot of mostly-white, mostly-male speaker rosters and panels. One way that has been proposed for speakers to take action is for white men to decline an invitation to speak at an event or on a panel that lacks diversity.</description>

      <description>Want to thank the people at More Than Men for having me. To start, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share a recent post from my own blog, then I&amp;rsquo;ll get to work on some original content. Enjoy!
You know, I had other things to do. Better things to do. I really, really wanted to stop being a complete asshole and actually answer my email, because I love my friends and I have been an irresponsible ass about that.</description>

      <description>I am also a white male. That&amp;rsquo;s right, I&amp;rsquo;m swinging pale pipe.
This means I have at least two major positions of privilege over many of my compatriots in all of these various fights, and that my privilege causes my words to be amplified while others&#39; meritorious positions are muted. In addition, I am cisgender, where my societally-expected gender comports with the physical sex I was born with; and my heterosexuality is likewise considered &amp;ldquo;the norm&amp;rdquo; in society, and I am therefore privileged by virtue of happening to be part of a majority where the minorities are often silenced, excluded or ignored, whether purposefully or not.</description>

      <description>Despite the annoying pop-over ads, I used to like The Good Men Project. It seemed to be a site for guys, mostly by guys, about not being horrible in the ways society tries to teach us to be. I mean, they had Amanda Marcotte write about MRAs, and that&amp;rsquo;s always good stuff. Then something happened. There&amp;rsquo;s still some good content there, sure, but it&amp;rsquo;s been infected by creepiness. You have articles about how stupid women don&amp;rsquo;t date Nice Guys because they&amp;rsquo;re brainwashed by rom-coms, creepy patriarchal pieces about sex trafficking where &amp;ldquo;your daughter&amp;rdquo; is equated with a drug, ridiculous straw-man replies to a woman who talks about rape culture, a decidedly mixed bag of whining and actually good stuff under the &amp;ldquo;presumption of guilt&amp;rdquo; tag, and then the infamous piece by a founder about how girls are just different from men and should stop being such nagging bitches.</description>

      <description>Noted anti-racist writer (and decidedly white white-guy) Tim Wise has an excellent piece about the myth of &amp;ldquo;reverse racism&amp;rdquo;, and I encourage you toread the whole thing. My favorite paragraph, though, is this one:
Does making fun of anyone, ever, make you a great person? No. (And I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a great person. Comedy often hurts someone&amp;rsquo;s feelings.) But making fun of men, white people, able-bodied people, straight people, etc is simply not the same as someone from those groups making fun of a minority.</description>

      <description>Like many people I was raised in a milieu with more than the usual amount of sexism and racism. I often say &amp;ldquo;I got better&amp;rdquo;, but the truth is, I&amp;rsquo;m getting better. I strive to learn more every day. To be empathic and listen to the experiences of people who are different with me. I work to be a better, more accepting and less horrible person. I&amp;rsquo;m an able-bodied, cisgendered, straight, white man.</description>

      <description>‚ÄòDiversity‚Äô is one of those words that people can get tired of hearing very quickly: it makes them feel guilty and insensitive, and it almost always raises acrimonious discussion until it fizzles out, leaving bitter emotions in its wake. A quick perusal of comment threads (such as here, here, and here) might lead one to think that there is a small number of privileged minorities who have nothing better to do then to complain, insult, and derail conversations towards their pet project: complaining about a problem that was solved years ago.</description>

      <description>[Sasha here. One of the main points of More Than Men is to get regular guys talking about why diversity matters to them. Here&amp;rsquo;s our first guest post making that happen.]
In the recent past our society has been making incremental steps towards the universal acceptance of diversity and the equality of all flavours of humanity, whether it be gender, race, sexuality, blood type or the amount of hair on your knees.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s come to our attention that there are some people who are a little confused by what the More Than Men project is all about. Perhaps because our original About was not as clear as it should have been, perhaps because a group of white guys gathering together for something that&amp;rsquo;s not horrible is such a novel concept, but somehow there are people who either have the wrong idea about us or who are skeptical about what we will actually be doing.</description>

      <description>Greta Christina has written about the &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; problem many of my fellow dudes have when listening to women talk about sexism and misogyny. I want to talk about a specific &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; here: &amp;ldquo;Y_es, but that&amp;rsquo;s not sexist because he/I/they don&amp;rsquo;t hate all women, just that one!_&amp;rdquo; The argument is that since the person slinging gendered slurs doesn&amp;rsquo;t hate women as a class, they aren&amp;rsquo;t a misogynist, therefore they&amp;rsquo;re just a jerk and we we can shut up about this problem and go talk about how dumb Christians are again.</description>

      <description>We live in a diverse world and I think we can all agree that any time a group‚Äôs makeup is less diverse than the world at large there are reasons for it. Here in the United States we have more diversity than most places, but when attending nerd events, atheist events, and skeptic events I keep finding myself in the majority. Why is that? I believe it is because something about those groups is making women and racial and sexual minorities feel like the group is Not For Them or are experiencing things that make them feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.</description>
