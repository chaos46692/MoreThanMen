      <title>Harassment policies are a good thing</title>

      <description>When asked what to do to make skeptic and atheist events feel more safe for women attendees and speakers, Stephanie Zvan blogged about a pretty simple thing to do: institute, publicize, and enforce anti-harassment policies. This is such an obvious step that I&amp;rsquo;m surprised every event doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clear policy in place. While there are some wild-eyed contrarians (and possible assholes) who think that harassment policies are oppressive and horrible, most people seem to agree that they&amp;rsquo;re a good idea and Stephanie&amp;rsquo;s post is making some real progress.</description>

In real life, I can be hot-headed. I can speak before thinking, and sometimes this involves a notable lack of decorum. That sometimes bleeds through onto my internet dealings, but I do make an effort to keep that to a minimum.
I am also very intolerant of intolerance and bigotry — I really hope that fact bleeds through, because it’s pretty much at the core of my character.</description>

      <description>In Wednesday’s post I implied that a lot of people think that combating sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, and ableism are too political and are not really something that skeptics should be worried about. Obviously I disagree but there are well known skeptic speakers who definitely think that those are not a part of “scientific skepticism” and we should instead only talk about ghost lights, psychics, and how stupid Catholics are.</description>

About a month ago, I was asked by an anti-feminist MRA on Twitter why I &amp;ldquo;believe in feminism&amp;rdquo;. I glibly replied that I am a feminist because I&amp;rsquo;m not a horrible person. The thing is, he&amp;rsquo;s not the only man who seems surprised by men who label themselves as a feminist and who work passionately toward equality for women.</description>

My partner, Kaylia, has many friends who are part of the transgender community. These are people who don’t fit the traditional gender roles in that they are living as members of the opposite sex, are undergoing medical procedures to change sex, don’t find themselves fitting into either male or female sex roles, or are biologically not clearly male or female to begin with.</description>

      <description>Wednesday’s post only got one comment here on the site, but I’ve looked at the discussion elsewhere on the web. Some people have said that when I see warning signs for misogyny I’m really just being mean and hateful to people with old fashioned values. I would argue that in many cases “old fashioned values” are misogynist, racist, and homophobic, but apparently some disagree.
What are some old fashioned values that are used to perpetuate and reinforce bigotry?</description>

      <title>10 Dating Misogyny Warning Signs</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a single guy who uses OkCupid to meet people, occasionally to hilarious effect. I also have a lot of women friends who date online and run in to guys who are pretty horrible. It also turns out that not everyone, male or female, is super skilled at spotting misogyny warning signs. That got me thinking ,which now got you this post.
A lot of these might seem really obvious, but in my experience these red flags are sometimes missed because when we&amp;rsquo;re looking for romance or sex online we&amp;rsquo;re often trying to see the best in people because we know that expressing yourself through a profile can be hard.</description>

      <description>I’m gonna let you guys in on a little secret today: science isn’t cheap. There’s a lot of fundraising that goes on to support the research which leads to the treatments that make life on planet earth longer and better. Unfortunately not everything gets the financial backing that it deserves.
What causes do and don&amp;rsquo;t get funded? Well, it isn&amp;rsquo;t always as impartial as you&amp;rsquo;d hope. Helping men past their prime get it up obviously isn&amp;rsquo;t a very pressing concern, but the prevalence of 80 year olds with limp dicks and disposable income prompted the creation of Viagra over treatments for say&amp;hellip; for Sickle Cell Anemia, which is actually life threatening (unlike erectile dysfunction) but tends to effect minority populations disproportionately.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday I wrote about a man who was influential in my evolution from stupid and entitled to less stupid and less entitled. Often when I am together with pro-equality, feminist, or social justice peeps we talk about how often we’re disappointed by the prominent men in our communities. Lets be positive for a change.
Who are your progressive male role models? Who has inspired you to be a better person?</description>

      <description>I’m writing this after having learned of the unfortunate and tragically young death of Adam Yauch, better known as MCA of the Beastie Boys. He died on Friday, May 4, 2012 — only 47 years old — from causes related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2009. Though only 11 years older than I am, he was one of the men who helped me become a feminist, a progressive, and less horrible over all.</description>

It is often that I doubt whether or not I truly wish to spend four years of my life here at West Point. The reasons are varied, but the one constant motivator that I have to stay is so that I can be part of the solution to all the issues that I see here. Sasha has been kind enough to give me an avenue to speak out.</description>

      <description>Not too long ago I tweeted a link to this video, because I liked it.
Then someone replied that they&amp;rsquo;d like to see the video about things men actually say to men who say shit to women on the street. They had a real point. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of silence from men and women both in response to street harassment. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of silence about inappropriate behavior in public in general.</description>

So, the Blunt Amendment (full text here) was voted down two weeks ago. The Blunt Amendment, for those not in the know, would have altered the requirements placed on employers that provide health insurance to their employees so that they would not be required to have insurance coverage that provided services that the employer or the insurance company finds morally objectionable.

      <description>###1) Make Skeptical Events Across the Country Less Alcohol Centric
Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re a 20 year old who is passionately invested in skepticism. You really want to meet others who feel the same way you do and have enlightening conversations with them! You go online and do a quick look-up of skeptical events held in your area. &amp;ldquo;Oh hey, Skeptics in the Pub!&amp;rdquo; you exclaim to yourself. Then it hits you: in the pub&amp;hellip; You&amp;rsquo;re not 21.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s often hard to keep promoting diversity in the world. The skeptic an atheist communities have a &amp;ldquo;big tent&amp;rdquo; that celebrates misogynists that deny the scientific facts of climate change and rewards misogynists that promote dangerous anti-vaccination nonsense but when we talk about how our movements can and should address and support issues unique to women, racial minorities, and the disabled, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans community we are told we&amp;rsquo;re reaching too far and are out of line.</description>

After I leave work this evening I’m headed to Berkeley for SkeptiCal 2012. If you’re in northern California you should really consider joining us. You can watch me drink whiskey in person!
This has got me thinking about skeptic and atheist conferences. What are they for? I&amp;rsquo;m going to let you in on a secret: When I go to conferences and cons (even science fiction and gaming cons) I almost never go to any programming.</description>

      <description>[This originally appeared on Anthroslug&amp;rsquo;s personal blog on April 2, 2012.]
I loathe the term “the Friend Zone.” It is one of those terms that seems to get thrown around without much thought, generally by men as an excuse for why they have had little success with dating and/or sex. My dislike for this term comes from my often-stated dislike for sloppy thinking and irrational claims, and as such I am not going to get into a discussion of whether or not the idea of the Friend Zone is born out of issues pertaining to privilege or misogyny (besides, [more articulate individuals than myself have already done so]](https://chaos46692.</description>

      <description>There is a debate within feminism about men. That debate is whether a man can really call himself a feminist. Some argue that since men have privilege that women do not have we cannot really understand the lives of women and therefore can be pro-feminist nit not actually be called feminists. Others say that this is limiting and is in it’s own way sexist, creating a women-only club that needlessly excludes male allies.</description>

Rather than rehash a lot of what has been hashed out and speculated upon ad nauseam regarding the case, I would like to speak to what I see as some broader questions.</description>

One thing that white men like myself really love to say is &amp;ldquo;I just see people.&amp;rdquo; This is super easy for us to do. It lets us tell the world &amp;ldquo;Hey, I totally don&amp;rsquo;t mind that you&amp;rsquo;re black/a woman/disabled/queer/trans&amp;rdquo; while also apparently letting us get out of actually acknowledging privilege and oppression. It also lets us change the subject so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep listening to oppressed people&amp;rsquo;s feelings.</description>

      <description>Good, it’s Friday. I’ve written before about microaggressions, those tiny, maybe apparently innocuous phrases, questions or comments that make us feel excluded, insulted, or objectified. I had one of those happened to me yesterday. Remember how Wednesday I wrote about my body and how my deviation from our cultural “norm” sometimes makes people feel entitled to treat me as an object? The very next day I was riding my train home from work.</description>

      <description>Whenever someone points out that someone, somewhere has said or done something sexist there’s a dude who chimes in with “But not all men are like that…” Then they or someone else gets angry and says that the person pointing out the sexism is a bigot or a misandrist or is making sloppy generalization because, you know, not all men are like that. (We’ll save for another time why so many male atheists think “not all Christians are like that” is silly but stick to their guns on this one.</description>

      <description>After work today I&amp;rsquo;m heading to literary science fiction/fantasy convention. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited. It&amp;rsquo;s probably too late for you this year, but next year you should consider going to FOGcon here in the San Francisco Bay Area. I&amp;rsquo;ll buy you a drink.
Anyhow, FOGcon has a clearly articulated and posted policy on harassment. This is something many conventions and conferences do. TAM has one as well, but there was a bit of a furor over it, including talk of boycotting the event.</description>

Over on Cracked.com David Wong has a piece titled &amp;ldquo;5 Ways Modern Men Are Trained to Hate Women&amp;rdquo; that I though would be useful as a tool to explain the ways that the &amp;ldquo;But I&amp;rsquo;m an atheist&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; argument doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold water. Just because you&amp;rsquo;re a skeptic or and atheist doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you&amp;rsquo;re not influenced by the society around you.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Jason Thibeault, no stranger to these parts, wrote a great summary of the recent fight to get trans rights legislation passed in Canada. Basically, no one at all is taking the bill seriously. What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that while the petition to get the MPs and media to take notice is languishing in obscurity there is another petition protesting a trans woman being kicked out of a beauty pageant. The petition to get trans people the rights they deserve and need is being mostly ignored while the petition to protest a cis-normative appearing trans woman being excluded from a venue for objectifying women is crazy popular, guys.</description>

      <description>Blogs get a lot of searches in the form of questions. Occasionally I will be answering those questions. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll answer a themed group, sometimes it will be a miscellaneous collection.
[Even your grandma got called a slut.]
###How do I know if I am a slut?
The cynical answer is &amp;ldquo;Someone will tell you.&amp;rdquo; The truth is that &amp;ldquo;slut&amp;rdquo; is, as our friend Matt Gubser has pointed out, a stupid insult.</description>

      <description>There seem to be a lot of men that enjoy gawking at hot chicks on the street. No matter how old the man is, whether he is married or single, he sees no problem with checking out all the women in sight. We are men after all, and we find women attractive, and have an urge to look at them. So, why not? It’s a powerful urge anyway. It’s almost impossible to resist.</description>

      <description>Sunday at the American Atheists’ National Convention those of us paying attention heard of a new group: Secular ProLife, who tag themselves as “Pro-life for a reason.” They may be religious people in secularists’ clothing, trying to tap in to what they see as an anti-woman market for their ideas in the secular community. They may also be genuinely secular people who want to share their message with their fellow atheists.</description>

      <description>I’ll give Rush Limbaugh one thing, he’s good at meme-generation. Though he says his friend at the Cato institute coined the word, “feminazi” sure has caught on over the last 20 years. “Feminazi” is, of course a ridiculous auto-Godwinning slur to throw around but it represents something much more widespread: the fact that the straw feminist is what so many people see as the “real” feminist.
It&amp;rsquo;s an old joke that anything someone says that follows &amp;quot; I&amp;rsquo;m not a racist, but&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; is always going to be horribly racist.</description>

      <description>Sasha here. Of course. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be awfully busy for the next week because in addition to running MTM I work full time and am also recently returned to college. This week school is monopolizing my reading and writing time and I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a lot of guest submissions or anyone interested in being a staff writer. So, unless I get more time or we get some new submissions I expect this place to be quiet until next week.</description>

      <description>Ouch. Yesterday Crommunist, who I admire and like, referred to my post about International Men’s Day as an example of “woefully ignorant, knee-jerk reactions to misogyny”. I’m not gonna argue with him, but instead see if we can talk about things. [Crommunist has clarified. He was referring to the “Why isn’t there an International Men’s Day” question – not my post in reply – as woefully ignorant and kneejerk. We are, and always have been, all good.</description>

      <description>[Today&amp;rsquo;s guest post is from a teacher who would like us to examine our assumptions about people based on appearance.]
Today I read an article about a 13-year-old student who said that the white teachers were not letting the minorities succeed. The student said the teacher just gave hand-outs that half of the students could not read. Later in the article it says that if there were more black teachers that the white teachers couldn’t hold the minorities back.</description>

      <description>On Friday there was a bit of a kerfuffle about a new billboard from American Atheists, Inc. The billboard is a response to Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s stupid new &amp;ldquo;Year of the Bible&amp;rdquo; as designated by the state legislature. I think most atheists, non-believers, and secularists see the problem with the government decreeing any year a year for Biblical thinking and study - that pesky 1st Amendment we all love. The problem many people had is the imagery and message used in the ad.</description>

      <description>Something that Natalie Reed touched on, is the fact that straight, white, cis men are seen as the “[default]“(https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreGenericWomenAreSpecial). This cultural message leads some male skeptics, who should really know better, to have internalized an idea that minorities have biases (because, obviously, they’re different!) and they do not. I think this is the biggest factor leading to what’s come to be called “mansplaining“. (When you think about it, “[mansplaining]”(https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mansplain) is not much different from what many skeptics and atheists do all the time when talk to theists, climate change deniers, creationists, anti-vaxers, etc.</description>

      <description>I despair and come close to just saying &amp;ldquo;fuck it&amp;rdquo; and abandoning my participation in the skeptic and atheist communities on at least a weekly basis because of how often I see unconscionable behavior not only happen but being defended by man, and in some cases at least tolerated by very prominent leaders in our community. Sam Harris has famously argued that &amp;ldquo;moderate&amp;rdquo;, liberal theists provide cover for religious extremists.</description>

      <description>From the start there has been a lot of internal and external discussion of whether or not a project like More Than Men with it&amp;rsquo;s country-club style membership can really serve a purpose in the movement for greater equality and diversity. Obviously I think it can, if only because there are some people who are receptive to the message but because of how society trains them they have a harder time hearing and understanding a minority voice.</description>

      <description>That’s just not true. I’m going to admit something right now. I’m a straight, white guy with a middle-class upbringing. I am also, irrevocably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and probably a host of other -ists and -phobics that you can toss at me. I’m like this because I’m a product of a society that is also racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and all the others. I’ve been taught a certain view of normalcy, and as a result, I act with mannerisms that reflect this certain view.</description>

      <description>Bullshit.
First off, we all have stories about that atheist who is not a critical thinker. My own is a guy who laughed at Christianity because their sole evidence was a book that is a few thousand years old. In the next breath he sang the praises of traditional Chinese magical ground-up penis herbal medicine, because it&amp;rsquo;s been practiced for thousands of years. In other words what was laughable as evidence for Christianity was compelling evidence for something that appealed to him.</description>

      <description>Is there a difference, as some have told me there is, between saying a woman &amp;ldquo;dresses like a slut&amp;rdquo; and calling her a slut?
Is there a difference between calling a man a whore and calling a woman a whore? Please explain why you think so.
Are women responsible for the sexual behavior of men around them if they dress a certain way? Where does that line get drawn? What does that say about men and their agency as humans?</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re all forced into this system and we have to reason our way out of it. Just like many of us reject the &amp;ldquo;common sense&amp;rdquo; arguments for religious belief and then we ask questions and gather information and draw a conclusion. Your average theist isn&amp;rsquo;t stupid or evil, they just haven&amp;rsquo;t done the work or had that &amp;ldquo;deconversion&amp;rdquo; moment.</description>

      <description>MISSING IMAGE
The most insidious form of douchebag is the Misunderstood Douchebag. You know the type: he&amp;rsquo;s really not that bad, people just don&amp;rsquo;t understand his ways. If only people got that what he was doing was noble and not at all in the blind pursuit of getting into girls&amp;rsquo; pants, the world would be a much fairer place. The Misunderstood Douchebag is the genus of the species Nice GuyTM.</description>

      <description>A reader hipped me to a video recently. I watched it. I can see the appeal, since it&amp;rsquo;s a video all about being awesomer to people. Something about it didn&amp;rsquo;t sit right with me, though. Here, you watch and then we&amp;rsquo;ll get back together after the jump and compare notes.
Okay, so, yes, it&amp;rsquo;s not nice to call people homophobic names. It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you more straight to do so.</description>

[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_596&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;alignleft&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;122&amp;rdquo; caption=&amp;ldquo;Hoping that I don&amp;rsquo;t sound like this.&amp;rdquo;] “Feminist” is a polarizing word. You’ll generally see it used in one of two ways: as self-identification by people who consider themselves feminists, and as a pejorative by people who do not.
It’s a word with an ugly connotation in many people’s minds, not unlike the word “atheist”; people hear the “-ist” suffix and infer an ideology that seeks feminine supremacy rather than gender equality, just as many see atheism as a rebellious denial of God rather than an affirmative acceptance of a godless universe.</description>

      <description>Like many within the skeptical community, I have been reading with interest the recent discussion which has been waged (or, should I say, raged?) on the topic of diversity within the skeptical movement. Apparently, it all goes back to this article – Why White Men Should Refuse to be on Panels of All White Men – which led to this blog post over at Skepchick. It also seems that there is a bit of a “storm” of controversy swirling as a result of the discussion generated by these articles.</description>

      <description>Well, the truth is there is a long history of secularism and humanism in the African-American community and it&amp;rsquo;s long past time that the rest of us took notice. There&amp;rsquo;s also a way we can help the growing numbers of atheists and free-thinkers of color. It&amp;rsquo;s call the Day of Solidarity for Black Non-Believers and I encourage you to help spread the word.
That last link was to a brand new site, African-Americans for Humanism, and it&amp;rsquo;s one I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about.</description>

A lot of guys, and all Nice Guys, like to talk about the Friendzone, which is a desolate wasteland of no-sex that men are cast into by callous women who don&amp;rsquo;t want to fuck them. It works like this: Dude likes a lady. I mean he REALLY likes her. She likes him, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t LIKE like him. He is banished to the Friendzone and his penis is dry forever after.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Just read your guide to not being a misogynist. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in your views on privilege from here in England. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how hot you are at proclaiming white, male, heterosexual males to be privileged.
&amp;ldquo;I agree to a certain extent, but domestically I feel that class, socio-economic, health and educational attainment are just as important. Therefore, in your mind I&amp;rsquo;m possibly one of those males who you may consider &amp;lsquo;just don&amp;rsquo;t get it&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>As we all know, the condition of one&amp;rsquo;s body has little bearing on their mind and what they can contribute to our communities. As someone who helps organize a skeptical conference in Northern California I found myself thinking how event organizers can take some extra steps to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on hearing any worthy voices in our cause. I asked for some input from skeptics and atheists with disabilities and have a few ideas myself.</description>

      <description>[NOTE: This was originally published in July 2011.]
First, some background It seems the whole thing got started when Rebecca Watson of Skepchick wrote about an encounter she had with a man in an elevator in Dublin. Long story short: the guy propositioned her, and she said no; she also felt somewhat cornered seeing as how she was stuck, alone, in a metal cage with the guy. Apparently, there were a number of people who thought she handled the situation poorly (especially by blogging about it and noting the inappropriate behavior on the part of the man in question).</description>

      <description>By now, everybody in the atheosphere is familiar with the Jessica Ahlquist story, and especially the latest development in the saga. The sheer amount of bigotry, hatred, and blind, unthinking idiocy on display by citizens of Cranston is astonishing, made no less so by their calls for religious tolerance.
&amp;hellip;wait for it&amp;hellip;.

Women are nice to look at. They’re quite often pretty, they have an appealing shape, and our sexuality drives us to want to copulate with them. 2. __Women who are intelligent and/or who agree with our world view are even nicer to look at. __I don’t know a single person in our communities who doesn’t say they are more attracted to other members of our community than they are to people with different views on science, rationalism, and religion.</description>

There has been a lot of high-profile success in this - TAM has been approaching 50/50 gender representation, for instance - but there still seem to be a lot of mostly-white, mostly-male speaker rosters and panels. One way that has been proposed for speakers to take action is for white men to decline an invitation to speak at an event or on a panel that lacks diversity.</description>

      <description>I am also a white male. That&amp;rsquo;s right, I&amp;rsquo;m swinging pale pipe.
This means I have at least two major positions of privilege over many of my compatriots in all of these various fights, and that my privilege causes my words to be amplified while others&amp;rsquo; meritorious positions are muted. In addition, I am cisgender, where my societally-expected gender comports with the physical sex I was born with; and my heterosexuality is likewise considered &amp;ldquo;the norm&amp;rdquo; in society, and I am therefore privileged by virtue of happening to be part of a majority where the minorities are often silenced, excluded or ignored, whether purposefully or not.</description>

      <description>Despite the annoying pop-over ads, I used to like The Good Men Project. It seemed to be a site for guys, mostly by guys, about not being horrible in the ways society tries to teach us to be. I mean, they had Amanda Marcotte write about MRAs, and that&amp;rsquo;s always good stuff. Then something happened. There&amp;rsquo;s still some good content there, sure, but it&amp;rsquo;s been infected by creepiness. You have articles about how stupid women don&amp;rsquo;t date Nice Guys because they&amp;rsquo;re brainwashed by rom-coms, creepy patriarchal pieces about sex trafficking where &amp;ldquo;your daughter&amp;rdquo; is equated with a drug, ridiculous straw-man replies to a woman who talks about rape culture, a decidedly mixed bag of whining and actually good stuff under the &amp;ldquo;presumption of guilt&amp;rdquo; tag, and then the infamous piece by a founder about how girls are just different from men and should stop being such nagging bitches.</description>

Oh, you&amp;rsquo;re fixing it? You&amp;rsquo;re fucking with people&amp;rsquo;s rights. Not privileges, rights.[Looks like Canada &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; it, but why can something like this even happen? Oh, I know: hate + apathy.] There&amp;rsquo;s this Women in Secularism conference happening in May.</description>

You see, men are horribly oppressed when it comes to sex and dating. They need sex so, so bad and stupid women just refuse to give it to them when they ask!</description>

      <title>Is it okay to make fun of white men?</title>

      <description>Noted anti-racist writer (and decidedly white white-guy) Tim Wise has an excellent piece about the myth of &amp;ldquo;reverse racism&amp;rdquo;, and I encourage you to read the whole thing. My favorite paragraph, though, is this one:
Does making fun of anyone, ever, make you a great person? No. (And I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a great person. Comedy often hurts someone&amp;rsquo;s feelings.) But making fun of men, white people, able-bodied people, straight people, etc is simply not the same as someone from those groups making fun of a minority.</description>

      <description>Like many people I was raised in a milieu with more than the usual amount of sexism and racism. I often say &amp;ldquo;I got better&amp;rdquo;, but the truth is, I&amp;rsquo;m getting better. I strive to learn more every day. To be empathic and listen to the experiences of people who are different with me. I work to be a better, more accepting and less horrible person. I&amp;rsquo;m an able-bodied, cisgendered, straight, white man.</description>

      <description>‘Diversity’ is one of those words that people can get tired of hearing very quickly: it makes them feel guilty and insensitive, and it almost always raises acrimonious discussion until it fizzles out, leaving bitter emotions in its wake. A quick perusal of comment threads (such as here, here, and here) might lead one to think that there is a small number of privileged minorities who have nothing better to do then to complain, insult, and derail conversations towards their pet project: complaining about a problem that was solved years ago.</description>

      <description>[Sasha here. One of the main points of More Than Men is to get regular guys talking about why diversity matters to them. Here&amp;rsquo;s our first guest post making that happen.]
In the recent past our society has been making incremental steps towards the universal acceptance of diversity and the equality of all flavours of humanity, whether it be gender, race, sexuality, blood type or the amount of hair on your knees.</description>

Stephen Hawking is Mystified by Women. In related news we&amp;rsquo;re mystified by people who pay attention to experts talking out their asses about things outside their specialty. Y U Mad, Whiteboy? This is Sasha&amp;rsquo; new favorite non-naked Tumblr. Rick Santorum has something for you ladies. (While we&amp;rsquo;re on the topic of Tumblr memes.) The Invisible Backpack of Able-Bodied Privilege Checklist. Because privilege isn&amp;rsquo;t just about men and women, folks. </description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s come to our attention that there are some people who are a little confused by what the More Than Men project is all about. Perhaps because our original About was not as clear as it should have been, perhaps because a group of white guys gathering together for something that&amp;rsquo;s not horrible is such a novel concept, but somehow there are people who either have the wrong idea about us or who are skeptical about what we will actually be doing.</description>

      <description>Greta Christina has written about the &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; problem many of my fellow dudes have when listening to women talk about sexism and misogyny. I want to talk about a specific &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; here: &amp;ldquo;Y_es, but that&amp;rsquo;s not sexist because he/I/they don&amp;rsquo;t hate all women, just that one!_&amp;rdquo; The argument is that since the person slinging gendered slurs doesn&amp;rsquo;t hate women as a class, they aren&amp;rsquo;t a misogynist, therefore they&amp;rsquo;re just a jerk and we we can shut up about this problem and go talk about how dumb Christians are again.</description>

      <description>We live in a diverse world and I think we can all agree that any time a group’s makeup is less diverse than the world at large there are reasons for it. Here in the United States we have more diversity than most places, but when attending nerd events, atheist events, and skeptic events I keep finding myself in the majority. Why is that? I believe it is because something about those groups is making women and racial and sexual minorities feel like the group is Not For Them or are experiencing things that make them feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.</description>
