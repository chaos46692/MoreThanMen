      We&rsquo;re still working on building our list of secular/skeptical/science events with harassment policies. It&rsquo;s grown some since we started, but we need your help. Even if you don&rsquo;t know about the policy, please comment here with the name of an event you attend or organize and, ideally, a link to their webpage. I&rsquo;ll do the work of tracking down a policy they may have that we can&rsquo;t find.
I think this is a non-controversial but important step.

      I’m a big fan of the Secular Student Alliance. For more than a decade they have been helping secular students organize for mutual support and activism. They provide resources to students, educators, and alumni to make schools safer and more welcoming for secularists. They are a true grass roots organization that is training and empowering the next generation of secular leaders and thinkers. They are also more diverse than most secular groups with older memberships.

      (More Than Men has addressed “the friendzone” before. Here’s a poem on a related topic by the Slam Master of Mill City Slam in Lowell, MA. – Sasha) I know that if anyone saves me in my hour of need it will be one of my ex-girlfriends.
One ex-girlfriend got me a job when I was destitute.
My ex Michele who is a nurse treated the cut on my arm when I didn&rsquo;t have health insurance it would have gone septic she said if I&rsquo;d waited any longer.

      As I wrote on Wednesday, I don’t see how there is anything controversial about events having or enforcing policies about harassment. We’ve even started building a list of existing harassment policies at conferences as a resource for event organizers, attendees, and speakers. Unfortunately it does seem like a lot of people do think these policies are a bad idea for our events.
One reason I&rsquo;ve seen given in opposition to harassment policies is that they are prudish and they inhibit the ability for adults to express their sexuality.

      When asked what to do to make skeptic and atheist events feel more safe for women attendees and speakers, Stephanie Zvan blogged about a pretty simple thing to do: institute, publicize, and enforce anti-harassment policies. This is such an obvious step that I&rsquo;m surprised every event doesn&rsquo;t have a clear policy in place. While there are some wild-eyed contrarians (and possible assholes) who think that harassment policies are oppressive and horrible, most people seem to agree that they&rsquo;re a good idea and Stephanie&rsquo;s post is making some real progress.

I am also very intolerant of intolerance and bigotry — I really hope that fact bleeds through, because it’s pretty much at the core of my character.

      In Wednesday’s post I implied that a lot of people think that combating sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, and ableism are too political and are not really something that skeptics should be worried about. Obviously I disagree but there are well known skeptic speakers who definitely think that those are not a part of “scientific skepticism” and we should instead only talk about ghost lights, psychics, and how stupid Catholics are. The idea seems to be that there was a “skeptical canon” established some time in the mid-20th century and that if we apply skepticism outside that we’re doing skepticism wrong or are “being political” and not rational.

My partner, Kaylia, has many friends who are part of the transgender community. These are people who don’t fit the traditional gender roles in that they are living as members of the opposite sex, are undergoing medical procedures to change sex, don’t find themselves fitting into either male or female sex roles, or are biologically not clearly male or female to begin with.

      Wednesday’s post only got one comment here on the site, but I’ve looked at the discussion elsewhere on the web. Some people have said that when I see warning signs for misogyny I’m really just being mean and hateful to people with old fashioned values. I would argue that in many cases “old fashioned values” are misogynist, racist, and homophobic, but apparently some disagree.
What are some old fashioned values that are used to perpetuate and reinforce bigotry?
