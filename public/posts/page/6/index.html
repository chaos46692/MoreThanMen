The most insidious form of douchebag is the Misunderstood Douchebag. You know the type: he&rsquo;s really not that bad, people just don&rsquo;t understand his ways. If only people got that what he was doing was noble and not at all in the blind pursuit of getting into girls&rsquo; pants, the world would be a much fairer place. The Misunderstood Douchebag is the genus of the species Nice GuyTM.

      A reader hipped me to a video recently. I watched it. I can see the appeal, since it&rsquo;s a video all about being awesomer to people. Something about it didn&rsquo;t sit right with me, though. Here, you watch and then we&rsquo;ll get back together after the jump and compare notes.
Okay, so, yes, it&rsquo;s not nice to call people homophobic names. It also doesn&rsquo;t make you more straight to do so.

      _ [This article was originally posted on August 29th, 2011 at Skeptic Freethought.]_
[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_596&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignleft&rdquo; width=&ldquo;122&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Hoping that I don&rsquo;t sound like this.&rdquo;] “Feminist” is a polarizing word. You’ll generally see it used in one of two ways: as self-identification by people who consider themselves feminists, and as a pejorative by people who do not.
It’s a word with an ugly connotation in many people’s minds, not unlike the word “atheist”; people hear the “-ist” suffix and infer an ideology that seeks feminine supremacy rather than gender equality, just as many see atheism as a rebellious denial of God rather than an affirmative acceptance of a godless universe.

      [caption id=&ldquo;attachment_580&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignleft&rdquo; width=&ldquo;150&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;Unfit for civilization.&rdquo;] In the last day much has been said about &ldquo;The Amazing Atheist&rdquo;, most notably (from my chair) by Jen McCreight, Greg Laden, and PZ Myers. Until this morning I didn&rsquo;t intend to address it in this space until reading the comment&rsquo;s on PZ&rsquo;s piece filled me with such a dark, bleak sense of despair about the state of humanity and the atheist/skeptical community. So, I&rsquo;d like to start out by stating, very clearly, exactly how I feel about this &ldquo;Amazing&rdquo; guy and his defenders.

      Like many within the skeptical community, I have been reading with interest the recent discussion which has been waged (or, should I say, raged?) on the topic of diversity within the skeptical movement. Apparently, it all goes back to this article – Why White Men Should Refuse to be on Panels of All White Men – which led to this blog post over at Skepchick. It also seems that there is a bit of a “storm” of controversy swirling as a result of the discussion generated by these articles.

      In addition to seeking one-time contributions, we&rsquo;re looking for one or two new staff bloggers. Please send me a message (sasha AT womenthinkingfree DOT org) with a little bit about yourself, a couple samples of your writing, and a drive to promote diversity in our communities. (You will have a salary of imaginary bacon, which is how we pay people around here. Yes, it&rsquo;s vegan.)

      Well, the truth is there is a long history of secularism and humanism in the African-American community and it&rsquo;s long past time that the rest of us took notice. There&rsquo;s also a way we can help the growing numbers of atheists and free-thinkers of color. It&rsquo;s call the Day of Solidarity for Black Non-Believers and I encourage you to help spread the word.
That last link was to a brand new site, African-Americans for Humanism, and it&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;m really excited about.

A lot of guys, and all Nice Guys, like to talk about the Friendzone, which is a desolate wasteland of no-sex that men are cast into by callous women who don&rsquo;t want to fuck them. It works like this: Dude likes a lady. I mean he REALLY likes her. She likes him, but she doesn&rsquo;t LIKE like him. He is banished to the Friendzone and his penis is dry forever after.

      &ldquo;Just read your guide to not being a misogynist. I&rsquo;m very interested in your views on privilege from here in England. It&rsquo;s interesting to see how hot you are at proclaiming white, male, heterosexual males to be privileged.
&ldquo;I agree to a certain extent, but domestically I feel that class, socio-economic, health and educational attainment are just as important. Therefore, in your mind I&rsquo;m possibly one of those males who you may consider &lsquo;just don&rsquo;t get it&rsquo;.
