      But why don&rsquo;t they turn on the barbarians and stop them?
Yesterday Richard Dawkins continued his recent campaign of xenophobia on Twitter with the following:
 Of COURSE most Muslims are decent people. But why don&rsquo;t they turn on the barbarians and stop them? â€” Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) March 10, 2013
 It seems like such a simple question, doesn&rsquo;t it? I assume Richard Dawkins thinks of himself as a decent person, as most atheists (OF COURSE) are, but why then does he not turn on the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and ableist &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; in our midst?

      A friend posted a link to this article on Slate about a married man with no kids who is a homemaker. I loved the article. Due, in no small part, to the fact that this very well could have been how my life ended up. At one point in my life I was a physics major dating a chemical engineer - pretty clear who was going to be earning the big bucks there.

      I&rsquo;ve been running More Than Men for a year now (even longer if you count the pre-launch preparation we did) and I&rsquo;m more proud than you can know of what I&rsquo;ve done and the response we&rsquo;ve generated &ndash; even the backlash from anti-feminists makes me proud. Unfortunately I need to step away for a few month to take care of some personal affairs. It breaks my heart to do so but I can&rsquo;t keep doing this and also keep doing the things I need to do in my private life and be successful at either.

      Over on Twitter the always fantastic Natalie Reed made a point about something that has been stewing in the back of my head for a while. Thanks to her I now know what to say. I made a handy Storify compilation for you to see what she had to say, below the cut.

      I&rsquo;ve written before about San Francisco&rsquo;s wife-beating sheriff and his fight to stay in office despite being on probation and, you know, not exactly being someone I would trust to have the best interests of domestic violence victims at heart. Well, it turns out that 4 of the city supervisors thing it&rsquo;s super cool to have an admitted domestic abuser serving as the city&rsquo;s top law enforcement official&hellip;while on probation.

      Last night the Republican party was able to share with us all an important lesson: In the modern world alienating women, people with disabilities, and racial &amp; sexual minorities is a losing proposition. Even Republicans are admitting that this is not our parentsâ€™ America.
The Republican Rape Squad of Mourdock and Akin were resoundingly defeated, despite running in fairly conservative districts. Marriage equality won big. Women in elected office are now at historic highs in the face of sexist antagonism and antipathy from the Republican party.

      It&rsquo;s been a week since Justin Vacula resigned from his leadership position with the Secular Coalition for America, but people are still talking about it. I supported, and signed the petition asking for him to be removed. Vacula resigned without any need for the SCA to act. That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m here for today.
I&rsquo;ve noticed a recurring meme from Vacula&rsquo;s defenders and from those who are &ldquo;trying to be neutral.

      Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz was a self-taught scholar , scientist, and poet - and later a nun - in Mexico during the 17th century. You&rsquo;re learning about her because I recently read one of her poems that proves that Nice Guys and slut shaming are nothing new.

      This year I was really bummed to be unable to attend Melody Hensley&rsquo;s fantastic, important, and much needed Women in Secularism conference. I was thrilled to learn that there would be a second one and even more thrilled when I saw the fantastic lineup of speakers Melody has recruited. I will be there in May 2013 and you should be, too &ndash; especially if you&rsquo;re a dude.
Religion and the cultural we share with the religious has a unique and problematic relationship with women.
