<p>But why don&rsquo;t they turn on the barbarians and stop them?</p>
<p>Yesterday Richard Dawkins continued his recent campaign of xenophobia on Twitter with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of COURSE most Muslims are decent people. But why don&rsquo;t they turn on the barbarians and stop them?
â€” Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/310618476257607680" target="_blank" >March 10, 2013</a>
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like such a simple question, doesn&rsquo;t it? I assume Richard Dawkins thinks of himself as a decent person, as most atheists (OF COURSE) are, but why then does he not turn on the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and ableist &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; in our midst? Why is Dr. Dawkins not allying himself with his fellow atheists who want to fix within our own community the very same problems he sees as evidence of the evils of Islam.</p>

 . I loved the article. Due, in no small part, to the fact that this very well could have been how my life ended up. At one point in my life I was a physics major dating a chemical engineer - pretty clear who was going to be earning the big bucks there. While I only remember pieces of specific conversation, I do remember talking about multiple times. I married a woman who has a passion for what she does, but unlike the engineering major ex I&rsquo;m definitely the primary breadwinner.</p>

Unfortunately I need to step away for a few month to take care of some personal affairs.

<p><strong>Content Note: Rape Culture</strong>
Lately, I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of comments on the interwebs from genuinely nice guys who want to know how to be good feminist allies in this shitty rape culture world we live in.

  (which in itself is a confusing term with about four distinct and sometimes mutually exclusive meanings) and helpful-versus-unhelpful anger and <a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2007/12/explainer-what-is-nice-guy.html" target="_blank" >nice guyism</a>

<p>Religion and the cultural we share with the religious has a unique and problematic relationship with women. If we want to use our secularism to improve the world and free people from the grip of religious dogma we need to examine the experiences and problems of all of humanity. Women in Secularism is a great step in that direction. I hope that the continued success of the event will lead to other large conferences on LGBT people, people of color, people with disabilities &ndash; all withing secularism, just where we want everyone to be.</p>
