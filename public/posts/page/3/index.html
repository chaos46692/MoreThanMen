      I think by now you’d have to have been living in a rather deep, dark hole to not have heard at least something about the sad case of Trayvon Martin’s death at the hands of George Zimmerman. Rather than rehash a lot of what has been hashed out and speculated upon ad nauseam regarding the case, I would like to speak to what I see as some broader questions.

One thing that white men like myself really love to say is &ldquo;I just see people.&rdquo; This is super easy for us to do. It lets us tell the world &ldquo;Hey, I totally don&rsquo;t mind that you&rsquo;re black/a woman/disabled/queer/trans&rdquo; while also apparently letting us get out of actually acknowledging privilege and oppression. It also lets us change the subject so that we don&rsquo;t have to keep listening to oppressed people&rsquo;s feelings.

      Good, it’s Friday. I’ve written before about microaggressions, those tiny, maybe apparently innocuous phrases, questions or comments that make us feel excluded, insulted, or objectified. I had one of those happened to me yesterday. Remember how Wednesday I wrote about my body and how my deviation from our cultural “norm” sometimes makes people feel entitled to treat me as an object? The very next day I was riding my train home from work.

I&rsquo;m a very large man. I&rsquo;m 6'5&quot; (~196 cm) tall and weigh in around 400 pounds (~181 kg). I started losing my hair when I was 16 years old. I wear glasses. Those are things I have little-to-no control over. I also have tattoos that are almost always visible and a beard ranging from goatee-and-mustache with stubble to full, depending on how ambitious I&rsquo;ve been lately.

      Whenever someone points out that someone, somewhere has said or done something sexist there’s a dude who chimes in with “But not all men are like that…” Then they or someone else gets angry and says that the person pointing out the sexism is a bigot or a misandrist or is making sloppy generalization because, you know, not all men are like that. (We’ll save for another time why so many male atheists think “not all Christians are like that” is silly but stick to their guns on this one.

      After work today I&rsquo;m heading to literary science fiction/fantasy convention. I&rsquo;m pretty excited. It&rsquo;s probably too late for you this year, but next year you should consider going to FOGcon here in the San Francisco Bay Area. I&rsquo;ll buy you a drink.
Anyhow, FOGcon has a clearly articulated and posted policy on harassment. This is something many conventions and conferences do. TAM has one as well, but there was a bit of a furor over it, including talk of boycotting the event.

Over on Cracked.com David Wong has a piece titled &ldquo;5 Ways Modern Men Are Trained to Hate Women&rdquo; that I though would be useful as a tool to explain the ways that the &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m an atheist&hellip;&rdquo; argument doesn&rsquo;t hold water. Just because you&rsquo;re a skeptic or and atheist doesn&rsquo;t mean that you&rsquo;re not influenced by the society around you.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Yesterday Jason Thibeault, no stranger to these parts, wrote a great summary of the recent fight to get trans rights legislation passed in Canada. Basically, no one at all is taking the bill seriously. What&rsquo;s interesting is that while the petition to get the MPs and media to take notice is languishing in obscurity there is another petition protesting a trans woman being kicked out of a beauty pageant. The petition to get trans people the rights they deserve and need is being mostly ignored while the petition to protest a cis-normative appearing trans woman being excluded from a venue for objectifying women is crazy popular, guys.

      Blogs get a lot of searches in the form of questions. Occasionally I will be answering those questions. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll answer a themed group, sometimes it will be a miscellaneous collection.
[Even your grandma got called a slut.]
###How do I know if I am a slut?
The cynical answer is &ldquo;Someone will tell you.&rdquo; The truth is that &ldquo;slut&rdquo; is, as our friend Matt Gubser has pointed out, a stupid insult.

      There seem to be a lot of men that enjoy gawking at hot chicks on the street. No matter how old the man is, whether he is married or single, he sees no problem with checking out all the women in sight. We are men after all, and we find women attractive, and have an urge to look at them. So, why not? It’s a powerful urge anyway. It’s almost impossible to resist.
