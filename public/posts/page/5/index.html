      I despair and come close to just saying &ldquo;fuck it&rdquo; and abandoning my participation in the skeptic and atheist communities on at least a weekly basis because of how often I see unconscionable behavior not only happen but being defended by man, and in some cases at least tolerated by very prominent leaders in our community. Sam Harris has famously argued that &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;, liberal theists provide cover for religious extremists.

      From the start there has been a lot of internal and external discussion of whether or not a project like More Than Men with it&rsquo;s country-club style membership can really serve a purpose in the movement for greater equality and diversity. Obviously I think it can, if only because there are some people who are receptive to the message but because of how society trains them they have a harder time hearing and understanding a minority voice.

      Not only will I be attending (though not speaking), but we&rsquo;ve managed to get an even split between male and female speakers including our parent organization&rsquo;s president, Elyse Anders of the Women Thinking Free Foundation.
Tickets until April 1st are $50 ($35 for students) and $60 for everyone thereafter so, get your tickets soon and save yourself some money for the bar!

      That’s just not true. I’m going to admit something right now. I’m a straight, white guy with a middle-class upbringing. I am also, irrevocably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and probably a host of other -ists and -phobics that you can toss at me. I’m like this because I’m a product of a society that is also racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and all the others. I’ve been taught a certain view of normalcy, and as a result, I act with mannerisms that reflect this certain view.

      Something lighter today. My good friend and my favorite comedian Matt Gubser gives his take on the questions I asked on Friday. This is him working on his bit before it&rsquo;s completely finished, so he&rsquo;s asked that you not judge him by it. I think it&rsquo;s hilarious, though.(Video is NSFW due to some salty language.)

      Don&rsquo;t worry about having something &ldquo;original&rdquo; to say (lord knows I&rsquo;m not very original), or for it being super-duper polished (you&rsquo;ve read my work, right), just write a few hundred words, make a video, draw a picture&hellip;and send it to me!

      Bullshit.
First off, we all have stories about that atheist who is not a critical thinker. My own is a guy who laughed at Christianity because their sole evidence was a book that is a few thousand years old. In the next breath he sang the praises of traditional Chinese magical ground-up penis herbal medicine, because it&rsquo;s been practiced for thousands of years. In other words what was laughable as evidence for Christianity was compelling evidence for something that appealed to him.

      Is there a difference, as some have told me there is, between saying a woman &ldquo;dresses like a slut&rdquo; and calling her a slut?
Is there a difference between calling a man a whore and calling a woman a whore? Please explain why you think so.
Are women responsible for the sexual behavior of men around them if they dress a certain way? Where does that line get drawn? What does that say about men and their agency as humans?

      Here&rsquo;s the thing: unless you start being an asshole I&rsquo;m not trying to make you feel like a crappy person. We&rsquo;re all forced into this system and we have to reason our way out of it. Just like many of us reject the &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; arguments for religious belief and then we ask questions and gather information and draw a conclusion. Your average theist isn&rsquo;t stupid or evil, they just haven&rsquo;t done the work or had that &ldquo;deconversion&rdquo; moment.
