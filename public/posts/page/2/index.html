      I’m writing this after having learned of the unfortunate and tragically young death of Adam Yauch, better known as MCA of the Beastie Boys. He died on Friday, May 4, 2012 — only 47 years old — from causes related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2009. Though only 11 years older than I am, he was one of the men who helped me become a feminist, a progressive, and less horrible over all.

It is often that I doubt whether or not I truly wish to spend four years of my life here at West Point. The reasons are varied, but the one constant motivator that I have to stay is so that I can be part of the solution to all the issues that I see here. Sasha has been kind enough to give me an avenue to speak out.

      Not too long ago I tweeted a link to this video, because I liked it.
Then someone replied that they&rsquo;d like to see the video about things men actually say to men who say shit to women on the street. They had a real point. There&rsquo;s a lot of silence from men and women both in response to street harassment. There&rsquo;s a lot of silence about inappropriate behavior in public in general.

So, the Blunt Amendment (full text here) was voted down two weeks ago. The Blunt Amendment, for those not in the know, would have altered the requirements placed on employers that provide health insurance to their employees so that they would not be required to have insurance coverage that provided services that the employer or the insurance company finds morally objectionable. As spelled out in the amendment itself:

      ###1) Make Skeptical Events Across the Country Less Alcohol Centric
Imagine you&rsquo;re a 20 year old who is passionately invested in skepticism. You really want to meet others who feel the same way you do and have enlightening conversations with them! You go online and do a quick look-up of skeptical events held in your area. &ldquo;Oh hey, Skeptics in the Pub!&rdquo; you exclaim to yourself. Then it hits you: in the pub&hellip; You&rsquo;re not 21.

      It&rsquo;s often hard to keep promoting diversity in the world. The skeptic an atheist communities have a &ldquo;big tent&rdquo; that celebrates misogynists that deny the scientific facts of climate change and rewards misogynists that promote dangerous anti-vaccination nonsense but when we talk about how our movements can and should address and support issues unique to women, racial minorities, and the disabled, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans community we are told we&rsquo;re reaching too far and are out of line.

After I leave work this evening I’m headed to Berkeley for SkeptiCal 2012. If you’re in northern California you should really consider joining us. You can watch me drink whiskey in person!
This has got me thinking about skeptic and atheist conferences. What are they for? I&rsquo;m going to let you in on a secret: When I go to conferences and cons (even science fiction and gaming cons) I almost never go to any programming.

I loathe the term “the Friend Zone.” It is one of those terms that seems to get thrown around without much thought, generally by men as an excuse for why they have had little success with dating and/or sex. My dislike for this term comes from my often-stated dislike for sloppy thinking and irrational claims, and as such I am not going to get into a discussion of whether or not the idea of the Friend Zone is born out of issues pertaining to privilege or misogyny (besides, [more articulate individuals than myself have already done so]](https://chaos46692.

      There is a debate within feminism about men. That debate is whether a man can really call himself a feminist. Some argue that since men have privilege that women do not have we cannot really understand the lives of women and therefore can be pro-feminist nit not actually be called feminists. Others say that this is limiting and is in it’s own way sexist, creating a women-only club that needlessly excludes male allies.
