      Greg Laden has enlisted several people in making a series of three videos for the project. Many thanks to Greg and all his friends (credits in the final chapter). Here&rsquo;s part one. Part two will be posted tomorrow, and part three on Friday. (Greg took it upon himself to organize this video, the people you see are Sheril Kirshenbaum, Desiree Schell, and Jafsica.)

      I am also a white male. That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m swinging pale pipe.
This means I have at least two major positions of privilege over many of my compatriots in all of these various fights, and that my privilege causes my words to be amplified while others&rsquo; meritorious positions are muted. In addition, I am cisgender, where my societally-expected gender comports with the physical sex I was born with; and my heterosexuality is likewise considered &ldquo;the norm&rdquo; in society, and I am therefore privileged by virtue of happening to be part of a majority where the minorities are often silenced, excluded or ignored, whether purposefully or not.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Despite the annoying pop-over ads, I used to like The Good Men Project. It seemed to be a site for guys, mostly by guys, about not being horrible in the ways society tries to teach us to be. I mean, they had Amanda Marcotte write about MRAs, and that&rsquo;s always good stuff. Then something happened. There&rsquo;s still some good content there, sure, but it&rsquo;s been infected by creepiness. You have articles about how stupid women don&rsquo;t date Nice Guys because they&rsquo;re brainwashed by rom-coms, creepy patriarchal pieces about sex trafficking where &ldquo;your daughter&rdquo; is equated with a drug, ridiculous straw-man replies to a woman who talks about rape culture, a decidedly mixed bag of whining and actually good stuff under the &ldquo;presumption of guilt&rdquo; tag, and then the infamous piece by a founder about how girls are just different from men and should stop being such nagging bitches.

      Noted anti-racist writer (and decidedly white white-guy) Tim Wise has an excellent piece about the myth of &ldquo;reverse racism&rdquo;, and I encourage you to read the whole thing. My favorite paragraph, though, is this one:
Does making fun of anyone, ever, make you a great person? No. (And I don&rsquo;t claim to be a great person. Comedy often hurts someone&rsquo;s feelings.) But making fun of men, white people, able-bodied people, straight people, etc is simply not the same as someone from those groups making fun of a minority.

      Like many people I was raised in a milieu with more than the usual amount of sexism and racism. I often say &ldquo;I got better&rdquo;, but the truth is, I&rsquo;m getting better. I strive to learn more every day. To be empathic and listen to the experiences of people who are different with me. I work to be a better, more accepting and less horrible person. I&rsquo;m an able-bodied, cisgendered, straight, white man.

      ‘Diversity’ is one of those words that people can get tired of hearing very quickly: it makes them feel guilty and insensitive, and it almost always raises acrimonious discussion until it fizzles out, leaving bitter emotions in its wake. A quick perusal of comment threads (such as here, here, and here) might lead one to think that there is a small number of privileged minorities who have nothing better to do then to complain, insult, and derail conversations towards their pet project: complaining about a problem that was solved years ago.

      [Sasha here. One of the main points of More Than Men is to get regular guys talking about why diversity matters to them. Here&rsquo;s our first guest post making that happen.]
In the recent past our society has been making incremental steps towards the universal acceptance of diversity and the equality of all flavours of humanity, whether it be gender, race, sexuality, blood type or the amount of hair on your knees.
