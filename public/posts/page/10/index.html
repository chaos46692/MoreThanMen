      <p>Yesterday Jason Thibeault, <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/00284_jason-thibeault-the-problem-with-privilege/" >no stranger</a>

  to get trans rights legislation passed in Canada. Basically, no one at all is taking the bill seriously. What&rsquo;s interesting is that while <a href="https://www.change.org/petitions/members-of-canadian-parliament-and-senate-pass-bill-c-279-the-trans-rights-bill#" target="_blank" >the petition</a>
  to get the MPs and media to take notice is languishing in obscurity there is another petition protesting a trans woman being kicked out of a beauty pageant. <a href="https://www.change.org/petitions/members-of-canadian-parliament-and-senate-pass-bill-c-279-the-trans-rights-bill#" target="_blank" >The petition</a>
  to get trans people the rights they deserve and need is being mostly ignored while the petition to protest a cis-normative appearing trans woman being excluded from a venue for objectifying women is crazy popular, guys. The takeaway: Society wants to masturbate to trans people but not allow them any basic rights or dignity.</p>

<p>###How do I know if I am a slut?</p>
<p>The cynical answer is &ldquo;Someone will tell you.&rdquo; The truth is that &ldquo;slut&rdquo; is, as our friend <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/00642_a-gentleman-does-not-tackle/" >Matt Gubser has pointed out</a>
 , a stupid insult. Calling a woman a slut or a whore is simply a way of policing and controlling her sexual freedom. Society has a complex about female sexual expression and in the mainstream women are either prudes (not sexual enough) or sluts (too sexual, or sexual in &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; ways). Being called a slut or a whore simply means someone has noticed that you have a sexual life and wants to make you feel shitty about it, wants to distract from your actual accomplishments or points (see Limbaugh v. Fluke), or wants to convince people that you&rsquo;re not worthy of associating with. Those people are wrong and are failures at being good people.</p>

<p>There seem to be a lot of men that enjoy gawking at hot chicks on the street. No matter how old the man is, whether he is married or single, he sees no problem with checking out all the women in sight. We are men after all, and we find women attractive, and have an urge to look at them. So, why not? It’s a powerful urge anyway. It’s almost impossible to resist. So why feel guilty about doing something that is fun, harmless, and that we can’t even help anyway?</p>

<p>Sunday at the <a href="https://atheists.org/convention" target="_blank" >American Atheists’ National Convention</a>
  those of us paying attention heard of a new group: <a href="http://secularprolife.org/" target="_blank" >Secular ProLife</a>
 , who tag themselves as “Pro-life for a reason.” They may be religious people in secularists’ clothing, trying to tap in to what they see as an anti-woman market for their ideas in the secular community. They may also be genuinely secular people who want to share their message with their fellow atheists. In either case I’m disgusted, angry, and disappointed. What I am not is shocked or surprised. There are <a href="http://www.godlessprolifers.org/home.html" target="_blank" >many</a>
  <a href="http://www.thinkatheist.com/forum/topics/antiabortion-atheists" target="_blank" >examples</a>
  of <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/2012/02/28/confessions-of-a-pro-life-atheist-why-i-fight-abortion/" target="_blank" >anti-abortion atheists</a>

<p>I’ll give Rush Limbaugh one thing, he’s good at meme-generation. Though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminazi" target="_blank" >he says his friend at the Cato institute coined the word</a>
 , “feminazi” sure has caught on over the last 20 years. “Feminazi” is, of course a ridiculous auto-Godwinning slur to throw around but it represents something much more widespread: the fact that the straw feminist is what so many people see as the “real” feminist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an old joke that anything someone says that follows &quot; I&rsquo;m not a racist, but&hellip;&quot; is always going to be horribly racist. How often do you hear people, especially women say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a feminist, but&hellip;&rdquo; and then say something that is, frankly, feminist? When did being a feminist become the moral equivalent, in some people&rsquo;s minds, of racism and homophobia? What&rsquo;s next? &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate feminists, some of my best friends are feminists.&rdquo;</p>

I think most atheists, non-believers, and secularists see the problem with the government decreeing any year a year for Biblical thinking and study - that pesky 1st Amendment we all love. The problem many people had is the imagery and message used in the ad. It struck many of us as racist at worse or insensitive at best. Here it is:</p>
