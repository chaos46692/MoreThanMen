<p>As I wrote about before Amy&rsquo;s gone and contacted male leaders within the skeptic and atheist communities to ask if they would like to speak out against the hate being directed at women by the cadre of angry, bitter sexists within our communities. The response she&rsquo;s gotten has been overwhelming, and I wanted to collect links to all of the statements she has so far to make sure people can see them.</p>
