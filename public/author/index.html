<p>My partner, Kaylia, has many friends who are part of the transgender community.  These are people who don’t fit the traditional gender roles in that they are living as members of the opposite sex, are undergoing medical procedures to change sex, don’t find themselves fitting into either male or female sex roles, or are biologically not clearly male or female to begin with.  The tendency in society in general (and here in Fresno in particular) is to treat these people with confusion, fear, and/or skepticism as to their gender or lack thereof.  <a href="http://skepchick.org/2011/11/transkeptuality-gatekeeping-and-the-value-of-critical-thought/" target="_blank" >Natalie of the Skepchick blog argues</a>
 , with a good deal of success, that this is due to a discomfort that people have with having their notions of gender challenged.&amp;  While I agree, I think that it also comes from a basic miscomprehension of what, exactly, gender is to begin with.  Gender and sex are not the same thing, and this seems to be at the root of much of the problem.</p>

<p>So, the Blunt Amendment (<a href="http://blunt.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/12ca4c96-d98c-4b37-920a-cdb15edb24d4/S.%201813%20Amendment.pdf" target="_blank" >full text here</a>
 ) was voted down two weeks ago.  The Blunt Amendment, for those not in the know, would have altered the requirements placed on employers that provide health insurance to their employees so that they would not be required to have insurance coverage that provided services that the employer or the insurance company finds morally objectionable.  As spelled out in the amendment itself:</p>

<p>I loathe the term “the Friend Zone.”  It is one of those terms that seems to get thrown around without much thought, generally by men as an excuse for why they have had little success with dating and/or sex.  My dislike for this term comes from my often-stated dislike for sloppy thinking and irrational claims, and as such I am not going to get into a discussion of whether or not the idea of the Friend Zone is born out of issues pertaining to privilege or misogyny (besides, [more articulate individuals than myself have already done so]](http://localhost:1313/posts/00516_nomads-of-the-friendzone/)).  Instead I will explain that my dislike for the term and concept comes from the sheer idiocy of it.</p>

<p>This weekend is a special weekend for me.  On Saturday, I will celebrate 11 years of marriage with my brilliant, amazing, strong and determined wife, Elyse.  And on Sunday, we will celebrate Elyse’s birthday, and Father’s Day.</p>
<p>This weekend, in many ways, is a celebration of my life.  The beauty of this weekend is I can share it with those I love most.  And while the commercial world says I need to go out and buy something made of steel for our anniversary, and buy some trinket or some other gift for Elyse’s birthday.  The expectation for Elyse is to give me some gift on behalf of our 2 children.  The truth is, this weekend is a celebration of the gifts we have already received.</p>

<p>Being between jobs, I spend a lot of time trying to keep myself busy during the day.  I tend to do a lot of chores and small projects that have gone neglected.  Over the last 2 months, the small projects have led several afternoon shopping runs.  During my shopping runs, I tend to swing through the toy section and see about something small for the kids.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, Barbie dominated the toy section.  In a normal department store, Barbie controlled about an aisle and half.  And in a toy store, whether it was Toys R Us, Circus World, Child’s World, or Kay-Bee, Barbie owned the girls’ section.</p>

 and a whole host of other people. I&rsquo;m not even going to try because the more I think about it the more irritated I become about Dr. Lindsay&rsquo;s careless remarks and reaction to criticism. I&rsquo;m simply not able to able to make a reasonable criticism will not turn into a giant &ldquo;fuck you.&rdquo; The experiences of the last week have given me many reasons to reflect on the arc of my life over the past few decades and how exactly I got here. I&rsquo;ve decided to write about the things that I&rsquo;ve learned about life and myself over the past 20 or so years.</p>

 . I loved the article. Due, in no small part, to the fact that this very well could have been how my life ended up. At one point in my life I was a physics major dating a chemical engineer - pretty clear who was going to be earning the big bucks there. While I only remember pieces of specific conversation, I do remember talking about multiple times. I married a woman who has a passion for what she does, but unlike the engineering major ex I&rsquo;m definitely the primary breadwinner.</p>

<p>As an organizer for my local Skeptic group, it was important to me to include an anti-harassment policy. My co-organizer and I very much wanted the gender ratio to be as close to 50/50 as it could be, for both speakers and attendees. To that end I wanted a good anti-harassment policy in place. I never imagined that it would be an issue. I guess at heart I&rsquo;ve been far too much of an optimist.</p>

<p>In real life, I can be hot-headed. I can speak before thinking, and sometimes this involves a notable lack of decorum. That sometimes bleeds through onto my internet dealings, but I do make an effort to keep that to a minimum.</p>
<p>I am also very intolerant of intolerance and bigotry — I really hope that fact bleeds through, because it’s pretty much at the core of my character. I’ve dressed down co-workers and acquaintances for ridiculous bits of bigotry in the past, even at potential personal cost. Two specific incidents spring to mind immediately: “that’s so gay!” used to refer to something the woman didn’t like, and “what does WIFE stand for? Washing, ironing, fucking, et cetera!” from a friend’s newly-introduced male fiancee. In both cases, I tried to register disapproval in such a way that it was both about their words being unacceptable generally, and because I was personally offended. In the latter case, my friend — let’s call her Laura, which is neither her name nor initial — and others were present, and she did not chime in, so the encounter ended effectively immediately after I registered my disapproval. The conversation moved on from there.</p>

<p>I am also a white male. That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m swinging pale pipe.</p>
<p>This means I have at least two major positions of privilege over many of my compatriots in all of these various fights, and that my privilege causes my words to be amplified while others&rsquo; meritorious positions are muted. In addition, I am cisgender, where my societally-expected gender comports with the physical sex I was born with; and my heterosexuality is likewise considered &ldquo;the norm&rdquo; in society, and I am therefore privileged by virtue of happening to be part of a majority where the minorities are often silenced, excluded or ignored, whether purposefully or not. I often don&rsquo;t realize I have these privileges &ndash; the fact slides neatly into the shadows behind my thoughts, and it&rsquo;s simply forgotten. As a result, sometimes in trying to help on one front, I&rsquo;m unintentionally doing damage on another.</p>

      <p>While at <a href="http://convergence-con.org/" target="_blank" >Convergence/SkepchickCon 2012</a>
  this past weekend, I did a lot of things, but one of the most fruitful and important was to attend the “Don’t Feed the Trolls” panel on the second day of the Con. The panel consisted of a number of prominent female skeptics (<a href="http://skepchick.org/author/rebecca/" target="_blank" >Rebecca Watson</a>
 , <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/cristinarad" target="_blank" >Cristina Rad</a>

  and <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/lousycanuck/" target="_blank" >Jason Thibeault</a>
 ) discussing the issues of gender attitudes, sexism, and misogyny in the skeptical movement. I think having these discussions in an open, public format is important, because there are a number of trolls out there who are not interested in reasoned, calm discussion on these issues; instead they are interested in intimidating those with whom they disagree and are attempting to silence them.</p>

Rather than rehash a lot of what has been hashed out and speculated upon ad nauseam regarding the case, I would like to speak to what I see as some broader questions.</p>

      <p>Like many within the skeptical community, I have been reading with interest the recent discussion which has been waged (or, should I say, raged?) on the topic of diversity within the skeptical movement.  Apparently, it all goes back to this article – <a href="http://www.good.is/post/why-white-men-should-refuse-to-be-on-panels-of-all-white-men/" target="_blank" >Why White Men Should Refuse to be on Panels of All White Men</a>
  – which led to <a href="http://skepchick.org/2011/06/ai-blinded-by-the-white/" target="_blank" >this blog post over at Skepchick.</a>
   It also seems that there is a bit of a “storm” of controversy swirling as a result of the discussion generated by these articles.  I think Amy Roth, the author of the aforementioned Skepchick article, articulated it well with the following commentary:</p>

   Long story short: the guy propositioned her, and she said no; she also felt somewhat cornered seeing as how she was stuck, alone, in a metal cage with the guy.  Apparently, there were a number of people who thought she handled the situation poorly (especially by blogging about it and noting the inappropriate behavior on the part of the man in question).</p>

<p>I thought that I had written all that needed to be said about the decietful, misogynist, forced-birth advocating, so called &ldquo;secular pro life&rdquo; movement <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/00761_anti-choice-anti-woman-and-anti-honesty-atheists/" >two years ago</a>
 . I didn&rsquo;t realize then that the current mostly-male &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; of the secular movement was composed almost entirely of misogynists, abusers, liars, and morally-bankrupt cowards. Those who are not anti-woman seem to be so obsessed with courting &ldquo;allies&rdquo; that they have no problems throwing women under the bus to advance their petty agendas.</p>

<p>There is an event happening in Ohio on November 2nd that might shock and surprise you for many reasons. It&rsquo;s an event to celebrate&amp; &amp; <em>Día de Muertos</em>, the Mexican holiday to commemorate and celebrate reflect upon your dead ancestors and loved ones, with a BDSM play party. We&rsquo;re grown ups and we know people have sex and even have kinky sex in groups. The part that may be a shock for some is that the organizer of the event is a self-described &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; educator. That&rsquo;s right: this crass event of cultural appropriation, where a holiday for remembering your dead friends and family is being used as exotic set dressing for an orgy is being organized by someone who thinks they are <em>helping</em> fight racism. But if you&rsquo;re surprised, it probably because you&rsquo;re white. Why do I feel comfortable making an assumption like that? Because of how privilege works.</p>

<p>From one cis hetero white man to another: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>I realize none of this is likely to make much of a difference to you, because you&rsquo;re not about accountability or criticism. No, not you Hugo. But you&rsquo;re hurting people. You are being an abuser. You are verbally abusing women of color, and then you apologize and cry about your mental illness and &ldquo;go away&rdquo;&hellip;but you come back. I think you will always come back so long as you feel like you can get away with it. Because I think you like to feel important. It seems that negative attention is almost as good as positive for you, and maybe there&rsquo;s that inner abuser that&rsquo;s really the core of who you are Hugo. Maybe the &ldquo;real&rsquo;&rdquo; Hugo isn&rsquo;t the man who writes about consent, but is instead the man who tried to kill his girlfriend. I think maybe that is the real you. I think maybe you used your mainstream white handsomeness and your abuser&rsquo;s facility at bullshit to talk your way into spaces where you could victimize on a grand scale.</p>

Others have talked about Robin Thicke and criticized the appropriateness of a married 36 year old dancing in a sexually suggestive way with a 20 year old women. All of those are stupid things to talk about. They are sex negative, misogynist, slut shaming, body policing nonsense. In the &ldquo;STDs and crack&rdquo; line you get bonus racist dog whistles, and as for the whole age-difference and suggestions of infidelity in the Cyrus/Thicke pairing, it&rsquo;s really not any of our place to speculate on what two adults and their partners see, do, or tolerate.

Another reason is that people have this idea of “objectivity” that is just plain wrong, because no one is objective.</p>

      <p>I was at the Center for Inquiry&rsquo;s second Women in Secularism conference last month. It was one of the best secular conferences I have ever attended and I hope there is another one next year. The staff, especially Melody Hensley did a remarkable job and I applaud them.</p>
<p>There were two dark clouds at the conference that dampened many people&rsquo;s enjoyment. One was a notorious part time &ldquo;activist&rdquo; and full time attention seeker who attended the conference in order to taunt feminists and report back to his vile, hateful, and dangerous friends at A Voice for Men. The other was Ronald Lindsay, the CEO of the Center for Inquiry, delivering opening remarks that offended many, if nor most, of the attendees and speakers. He then chose not to attend a fundraising dinner (where the people who felt he had insulted them were asked to donate money above and beyond the $250 event ticket) so that he could write a retort to the criticism of his remarks. A retort in which he said some very impolitic and unprofessional things about one of his speakers in particular. I was late arriving at the conference so I missed his talk and haven&rsquo;t said anything publicly about this all. I have, however, been watching to see CFI&rsquo;s response after their board met to discuss the affair.</p>

<p>But why don&rsquo;t they turn on the barbarians and stop them?</p>
<p>Yesterday Richard Dawkins continued his recent campaign of xenophobia on Twitter with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of COURSE most Muslims are decent people. But why don&rsquo;t they turn on the barbarians and stop them?
— Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/310618476257607680" target="_blank" >March 10, 2013</a>
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like such a simple question, doesn&rsquo;t it? I assume Richard Dawkins thinks of himself as a decent person, as most atheists (OF COURSE) are, but why then does he not turn on the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and ableist &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; in our midst? Why is Dr. Dawkins not allying himself with his fellow atheists who want to fix within our own community the very same problems he sees as evidence of the evils of Islam.</p>

Lately, I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of comments on the interwebs from genuinely nice guys who want to know how to be good feminist allies in this shitty rape culture world we live in.

<p>Religion and the cultural we share with the religious has a unique and problematic relationship with women. If we want to use our secularism to improve the world and free people from the grip of religious dogma we need to examine the experiences and problems of all of humanity. Women in Secularism is a great step in that direction. I hope that the continued success of the event will lead to other large conferences on LGBT people, people of color, people with disabilities &ndash; all withing secularism, just where we want everyone to be.</p>

<p>How to convince men to be allies to women is something I have been trying to master for more than a year now, most actively since I started my blogging project with the new year. It’s honestly not an easy task. The biggest response I get is a lot of apathy from other men, and then I get the occasional outright enmity from some die-hards I can only call misogynists.</p>

      <p>Here in San Francisco domestic violence has been in the news for all of 2012. The abuser just happens to be our sheriff. I&rsquo;m bringing it up because it&rsquo;s a public case that documents many of the strategies employed by misogynist shitlords when they&rsquo;re confronted by distaste from decent people.</p>
<p>Ross Mirkarimi was elected sheriff of the city and county of San Francisco in November of 2011. Over New Year&rsquo;s Mirkarimi and his wife Eliana Lopez got into an argument that became physical. Lopez went to a neighbor who <a href="http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2012/01/ross_mirkarimi_ivory_madison.php" target="_blank" >was a fundraiser for Mirkarimi&rsquo;s election campaign</a>
 . Lopez showed the neighbor bruises and made a video to document the abuse. Lopez told the neighbor that she wanted to document the abuse because of fears that Mirkarimi would take their children away from her. Lopez indicated that she had been telling Mirkarimi that they &ldquo;need help.&rdquo; The next day Lopez contacted the neighbor and implored her not to contact the police about the abuse. Two days after that, on January 4th the neighbor did call the police. The investigation became public on Friday the 6th &ndash; two days before Mirkarimi was due to assume his duties as sheriff. Under a cloud of controversy - but with no charges formally pressed &ndash; Mirkarimi was sworn in as sheriff on January 8th.</p>

<p>Because of my name and the poor reading comprehension of most misogynists I&rsquo;ve gotten one rape threat while writing about feminism. That&rsquo;s nothing compared to what women get. The way society tries to silence women is appalling and well documented. It really turns the stomach of anyone with a trace of humanity. Society has other, gentler, ways of silencing and dismissing feminist men, though. I want to talk about those today, not to climb on a cross or to equate what male feminists like me experience to what women encounter, but to show men that they&rsquo;re not alone when these things get hurled at them. I want other men to know they&rsquo;re not alone and that they don&rsquo;t have to be silent or feign neutrality about equality just because society wants them to.</p>

      <p>Since women in the industrialized world have things so good compared to women in countries run by brown religious people and should just STFU already about sexism in their lives, I have prepared a handy list of things you should stop talking about because there are so many worse things happening in the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop writing about or investigating ghosts and cryptozoology at home. Don&rsquo;t you know there are people being killed as witches in Africa?</li>
<li>Stop complaining about what religious conservatives are doing in your own country. Aren&rsquo;t you aware that atheism and blasphemy carry a death sentence in other countries?</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry your little head about the science curricula in your locals schools. Some countries don&rsquo;t even <em>have</em> schools.</li>
<li>Worrying about herd immunity and vaccine denialism in industrialized nations  is pretty stupid when you consider that in some countries people think that raping a virgin cures AIDS.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you see what I&rsquo;m doing here. My point is that anti-feminists who say &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse for women elsewhere, so STFU&rdquo; are hypocrites and are seasoning their hypocrisy with some xenophobic racism. Please remind them of that (or direct them here) when you see them dismiss people working toward equality.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m tired of calling the discussion about sexism within the skeptic and atheist movements a &ldquo;controversy&rdquo;. As I see it,  what myself and others who talk about the fact that our communities are as subject to sexism (and racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc) as the rest of society are encountering is denialism. Look, we <em>know</em> that skeptics and atheists aren&rsquo;t perfect. Aspiring to an ideal of rationality and fairness doesn&rsquo;t make us perfect, it just means we&rsquo;re trying to be better. As we know, there are prominent skeptics involved in serious legal troubles. There are prominent skeptics with troubling views about climate change. Skeptics and atheists are people, flawed and aspiring to be better &ndash; just like everyone in the world.</p>

<p>Their main argument, as far as I can tell in between the derailing, namecalling, Godwinning, and other extreme ridiculousness is that it&rsquo;s unnecessary and punitive to have a freedom-crippling set of rules governing how people treat each other. They seem to be saying that decent people are decent and most people are decent and anyway those online rape threats are just weirdos who never go anywhere and anyway they never saw anyone being sexually harassed at a conference.

  using basically the same ridiculous nonsense reactionary and hateful atheists have been using to try and pillory her about being a woman for years.

Has Mr. Give-me-leg-biting-or-give-me-death decided that crushing female resistance is more important than his atheistic principles, or did creationists just hear about Ms. Watson&rsquo;s crimes against masculinity through his &ldquo;work&rdquo;? Probably the latter, but the idea of these skeptical atheists who hyperventilate over uppity ladies deciding that feminism is an enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend situation and allying themselves with creationist lunatics is&hellip;sort of delightful.</p>

<p>Those of us who argue for diversity are prone to empathy. We not only see that our position is logical and reasonable, but we are passionate about it. We feel about these things very strongly. These issues matter to us very much. It’s why we’re so prone to burnout. We pour are hearts into this and it hurts us when we’re attacked about these things. Since More Than Men started at the beginning of the year I have felt used up and beat up and emotionally exhausted several times, and I don’t even get the worst sort of abuse. The only rape threat I ever received was from someone who didn’t even care enough to notice that I’m a guy.</p>

Even if you don&rsquo;t know about the policy, please comment here with the name of an event you attend or organize and, ideally, a link to their webpage. I&rsquo;ll do the work of tracking down a policy they may have that we can&rsquo;t find.</p>
<p>I think this is a non-controversial but important step. The more it becomes the norm for our events to articulate their willingness and desire to make <em>everyone</em> welcome the better things will be for <em>everyone</em> who attends. (After we have a good frip on harassment policies I hope to start a similar resource for disability accommodations.)</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of the <a href="https://www.secularstudents.org/" target="_blank" >Secular Student Alliance</a>
 . For more than a decade they have been helping secular students organize for mutual support and activism. They provide resources to students, educators, and alumni to make schools safer and more welcoming for secularists. They are a true grass roots organization that is training and empowering the next generation of secular leaders and thinkers. They are also more diverse than most secular groups with older memberships. All this is awesome stuff and I’m a moral as well as financial supporter.</p>

<p>As I <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/00982_harassment-policies-are-a-good-thing/" >wrote on Wednesday</a>
 , I don’t see how there is anything controversial about events having or enforcing policies about harassment. We’ve even started building a <a href="http://localhost:1313/harassment-policies/" >list of existing harassment policies</a>
  at conferences as a resource for event organizers, attendees, and speakers. Unfortunately it does seem like a lot of people do think these policies are a bad idea for our events.</p>
<p>One reason I&rsquo;ve seen given in opposition to harassment policies is that they are prudish and they inhibit the ability for adults to express their sexuality. Basically they say that these policies have a &ldquo;chilling&rdquo;&amp;  effect on skeptics and atheists meeting and having sex at conferences. Others argue that <em>not</em> having and enforcing these policies have a &ldquo;chilling&rdquo; effect on women attending in large numbers.</p>

  I implied that a lot of people think that combating sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, and ableism are too political and are not really something that skeptics should be worried about. Obviously I disagree but there are well known skeptic speakers who definitely think that those are not a part of “scientific skepticism” and we should instead only talk about ghost lights, psychics, and how stupid Catholics are. The idea seems to be that there was a “skeptical canon” established some time in the mid-20th century and that if we apply skepticism outside that we’re doing skepticism wrong or are “being political” and not rational. On the other hand, lots of skeptics I know think that, for example, cryptozoology is kind of silly and is a waste of time.</p>

  only got one comment here on the site, but I’ve looked at the discussion elsewhere on the web. Some people have said that when I see warning signs for misogyny I’m really just being mean and hateful to people with old fashioned values. I would argue that in many cases “old fashioned values” are misogynist, racist, and homophobic, but apparently some disagree.</p>
<p><strong>What are some old fashioned values that are used to perpetuate and reinforce bigotry? What are some old fashioned values that are worth keeping?</strong></p>

<p>A lot of these might seem really obvious, but in my experience these red flags are sometimes missed because when we&rsquo;re looking for romance or sex online we&rsquo;re often trying to see the best in people because we know that expressing yourself through a profile can be hard. It&rsquo;s also true that many of these don&rsquo;t necessarily mean the guy is a creep, but it&rsquo;s a good idea to proceed with caution when things like this crop up.</p>

<p>I’m writing this after having learned of the unfortunate and tragically young death of Adam Yauch, better known as MCA of the Beastie Boys. He died on Friday, May 4, 2012 — only 47 years old — from causes related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2009. Though only 11 years older than I am, he was one of the men who helped me become a feminist, a progressive, and less horrible over all.</p>

<p>There is a debate within feminism about men. That debate is whether a man can really call himself a feminist. Some argue that since men have privilege that women do not have we cannot really understand the lives of women and therefore can be pro-feminist nit not actually be called feminists. Others say that this is limiting and is in it’s own way sexist, creating a women-only club that needlessly excludes male allies.</p>

<p>One thing that white men like myself really love to say is &ldquo;I just see people.&rdquo; This is super easy for us to do. It lets us tell the world &ldquo;Hey, I totally don&rsquo;t mind that you&rsquo;re black/a woman/disabled/queer/trans&rdquo; while also apparently letting us get out of actually acknowledging privilege and oppression. It also lets us change the subject so that we don&rsquo;t have to keep listening to oppressed people&rsquo;s feelings. THe thing is, you can&rsquo;t opt out of society that way. People of color are oppressed. Women are oppressed. Disabled people are oppressed. Queer people are oppressed. Trans people are oppressed. Just because we aren&rsquo;t oppressed and just because we don&rsquo;t personally have a problem with any of those oppressed people doesn&rsquo;t mean we get away with just saying &ldquo;I just see people&rdquo; and changing the subject.</p>

  and how my deviation from our cultural “norm” sometimes makes people feel entitled to treat me as an object? The very next day I was riding my train home from work. I was listening to music and reading. A teenager stopped in front of me and started talking. I paused the music, set down my Kindle and said “What?” The kid replied “I’m selling chocolate to raise money for school. Want to help? I know you like candy.” Because I’m fat, ya know.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a very large man. I&rsquo;m 6'5&quot; (~196 cm) tall and weigh in around 400 pounds (~181 kg). I started losing my hair when I was 16 years old. I wear glasses. Those are things I have little-to-no control over. I also have tattoos that are almost always visible and a beard ranging from goatee-and-mustache with stubble to full, depending on how ambitious I&rsquo;ve been lately. I&rsquo;m funny looking. My appearance attracts attention.</p>

<p>Whenever someone points out that someone, somewhere has said or done something sexist there’s a dude who chimes in with “But not all men are like that…” Then they or someone else gets angry and says that the person pointing out the sexism is a bigot or a misandrist or is making sloppy generalization because, you know, not all men are like that. (We’ll save for another time why so many male atheists think “not all Christians are like that” is silly but stick to their guns on this one.) I get angry too when someone points out sexism. I get angry at the sexists.</p>

<p>###How do I know if I am a slut?</p>
<p>The cynical answer is &ldquo;Someone will tell you.&rdquo; The truth is that &ldquo;slut&rdquo; is, as our friend <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/00642_a-gentleman-does-not-tackle/" >Matt Gubser has pointed out</a>
 , a stupid insult. Calling a woman a slut or a whore is simply a way of policing and controlling her sexual freedom. Society has a complex about female sexual expression and in the mainstream women are either prudes (not sexual enough) or sluts (too sexual, or sexual in &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; ways). Being called a slut or a whore simply means someone has noticed that you have a sexual life and wants to make you feel shitty about it, wants to distract from your actual accomplishments or points (see Limbaugh v. Fluke), or wants to convince people that you&rsquo;re not worthy of associating with. Those people are wrong and are failures at being good people.</p>

<p>There seem to be a lot of men that enjoy gawking at hot chicks on the street. No matter how old the man is, whether he is married or single, he sees no problem with checking out all the women in sight. We are men after all, and we find women attractive, and have an urge to look at them. So, why not? It’s a powerful urge anyway. It’s almost impossible to resist. So why feel guilty about doing something that is fun, harmless, and that we can’t even help anyway?</p>

<p>Sunday at the <a href="https://atheists.org/convention" target="_blank" >American Atheists’ National Convention</a>
  those of us paying attention heard of a new group: <a href="http://secularprolife.org/" target="_blank" >Secular ProLife</a>
 , who tag themselves as “Pro-life for a reason.” They may be religious people in secularists’ clothing, trying to tap in to what they see as an anti-woman market for their ideas in the secular community. They may also be genuinely secular people who want to share their message with their fellow atheists. In either case I’m disgusted, angry, and disappointed. What I am not is shocked or surprised. There are <a href="http://www.godlessprolifers.org/home.html" target="_blank" >many</a>
  <a href="http://www.thinkatheist.com/forum/topics/antiabortion-atheists" target="_blank" >examples</a>

<p>I’ll give Rush Limbaugh one thing, he’s good at meme-generation. Though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminazi" target="_blank" >he says his friend at the Cato institute coined the word</a>
 , “feminazi” sure has caught on over the last 20 years. “Feminazi” is, of course a ridiculous auto-Godwinning slur to throw around but it represents something much more widespread: the fact that the straw feminist is what so many people see as the “real” feminist.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an old joke that anything someone says that follows &quot; I&rsquo;m not a racist, but&hellip;&quot; is always going to be horribly racist. How often do you hear people, especially women say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a feminist, but&hellip;&rdquo; and then say something that is, frankly, feminist? When did being a feminist become the moral equivalent, in some people&rsquo;s minds, of racism and homophobia? What&rsquo;s next? &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hate feminists, some of my best friends are feminists.&rdquo;</p>

I think most atheists, non-believers, and secularists see the problem with the government decreeing any year a year for Biblical thinking and study - that pesky 1st Amendment we all love. The problem many people had is the imagery and message used in the ad. It struck many of us as racist at worse or insensitive at best. Here it is:</p>

<p>Something that <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/00696_natalie-reed-thoughts-from-a-diversity-hire/" >Natalie Reed</a>

 . This cultural message leads some male skeptics, who should really know better, to have internalized an idea that minorities have biases (because, obviously, they’re different!) and they do not. I think this is the biggest factor leading to what’s come to be called “mansplaining“. (When you think about it, “[mansplaining]”(<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mansplain" target="_blank" >https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mansplain</a>
 ) is not much different from what many skeptics and atheists do all the time when talk to theists, climate change deniers, creationists, anti-vaxers, etc. The difference here is that they aren’t really talkinmg facts, they’re often talking feelings – filtered through bias.) As a student of history I’ve learned the lesson all historians have to get really quick: Everyone is biased.</p>

<p>I despair and come close to just saying &ldquo;fuck it&rdquo; and abandoning my participation in the skeptic and atheist communities on at least a weekly basis because of how often I see unconscionable behavior not only happen but being defended by man, and in some cases at least tolerated by very prominent leaders in our community. Sam Harris has famously argued that &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;, liberal theists provide cover for religious extremists. I see the same thing happening here. People who defend &ldquo;minor&rdquo; sexist acts and ideas, or who even just avoid talking about it are providing cover and a safe-haven for the people who threaten to rape 15 year old girls on reddit and who actually commit sexual assault and rape.</p>

<p>From the start there has been a lot of internal and external discussion of whether or not a project like More Than Men with it&rsquo;s country-club style membership can really serve a purpose in the movement for greater equality and diversity. Obviously I think it can, if only because there are some people who are receptive to the message but because of how society trains them they have a harder time hearing and understanding a minority voice. But straight, white, cis, able-bodied men can&rsquo;t be all there is anywhere. Now that we&rsquo;ve got almost two months behind us here it&rsquo;s time to get closer to where I&rsquo;ve wanted us to be all along.</p>

<p>That’s just not true. I’m going to admit something right now. I’m a straight, white guy with a middle-class upbringing. I am also, irrevocably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and probably a host of other -ists and -phobics that you can toss at me. I’m like this because I’m a product of a society that is also racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and all the others. I’ve been taught a certain view of normalcy, and as a result, I act with mannerisms that reflect this certain view. It’s not an attempt to insult; I’m not consciously discriminatory. But it’s still there.</p>

<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>First off, we all have stories about that atheist who is not a critical thinker. My own is a guy who laughed at Christianity because their sole evidence was a book that is a few thousand years old. In the next breath he sang the praises of traditional Chinese <del>magical ground-up penis</del> herbal medicine, because it&rsquo;s been practiced for thousands of years. In other words what was laughable as evidence for Christianity was compelling evidence for something that appealed to him. What does this mean? This means that rejecting religion doesn&rsquo;t mean rejecting bullshit. According to Christopher Bader&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0814791352/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=sashasdenofiniqu&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0814791352" target="_blank" ><em>Paranormal America</em></a>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: unless you start being an asshole I&rsquo;m not trying to make you feel like a crappy person. We&rsquo;re all forced into this system and we have to reason our way out of it. Just like many of us reject the &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; arguments for religious belief and then we ask questions and gather information and draw a conclusion. Your average theist isn&rsquo;t stupid or evil, they just haven&rsquo;t done the work or had that &ldquo;deconversion&rdquo; moment. When you start kicking and screaming and throwing temper tantrums because someone has challenged your assumptions what does that make you? Does that make you a free-thinker? A skeptic?  No, it makes you a tradition-bound and close-minded person who is being willfully ignorant. When you reject new information because it is inconvenient (or because maybe you just don&rsquo;t trust women, perhaps) <em>then</em> you become an asshole.</p>

<p>Lets look at some of these categories and some of the groups (western) society recognizes with them:</p>
<p>###Sex and Gender</p>
<ul>
<li>Male
<ul>
<li>Female</li>
<li>Intersex</li>
<li>Transgender</li>
<li>Cisgender</li>

<li>Black
<ul>
<li>White</li>
<li>Latino</li>
<li>Asian</li>
<li>Native American</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>###Religious Belief</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Atheist</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian</li>
<li>Jewish</li>
<li>Muslim</li>
<li>Hindu

<li>Homosexual</li>
<li>Bisexual</li>

<p>###Class</p>

<li>Poor</li>
<li>Working class</li>

<p>&hellip;I could go on and on, but I think we have enough to work with. As you look over those you will no doubt see that in every category there is a group with more privilege than the others. Some have less privilege (remember we&rsquo;re talking about special advantages or immunities here) than the &ldquo;top dog&rdquo;, but more than other groups in the category. Got it?</p>

<p>Okay, so, yes, it&rsquo;s not nice to call people homophobic names. It also doesn&rsquo;t make you more straight to do so. (I think the only thing that makes men straight - or at least bisexual - is cunnilingus. True story.) I have two problems with the video that won&rsquo;t let me endorse it completely:</p>

<p>“Feminist” is a polarizing word.  You’ll generally see it used in one of two ways: as self-identification by people who consider themselves feminists, and as a pejorative by people who do not.</p>
<p>It’s a word with an ugly connotation in many people’s minds, not unlike the word “atheist”; people hear the “-ist” suffix and infer an ideology that seeks feminine supremacy rather than gender equality, just as many see atheism as a rebellious denial of God rather than an affirmative acceptance of a godless universe.</p>

<p>Well, the truth is there is a long history of secularism and humanism in the African-American community and it&rsquo;s long past time that the rest of us took notice. There&rsquo;s also a way we can help the growing numbers of atheists and free-thinkers of color. It&rsquo;s call the <a href="http://aahumanism.net/announcements/view/day_of_solidarity_for_black_non_believers" target="_blank" >Day of Solidarity for Black Non-Believers</a>
  and I encourage you to help spread the word.</p>
<p>That last link was to a brand new site, <a href="http://aahumanism.net/" target="_blank" >African-Americans for Humanism</a>
 , and it&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;m really excited about. I salute <a href="http://aahumanism.net/stories/view/debbie_goddard" target="_blank" >Debbie Goddard</a>
  and thank her for her work on this project. I&rsquo;m a white dude, but I know how important this is and hope to see her soon overwhelmed with work as this project takes off. I will also be looking at ways I can help the cause.</p>

<p>A lot of guys, and all Nice Guys, like to talk about the Friendzone, which is a desolate wasteland of no-sex that men are cast into by callous women who don&rsquo;t want to fuck them. It works like this: Dude likes a lady. I mean he REALLY likes her. She likes him, but she doesn&rsquo;t LIKE like him. He is banished to the Friendzone and his penis is dry forever after. What&rsquo;s worse, she keeps being friends with the guy who she has betrayed (by not sucking his dick) and has the audacity to date and copulate with OTHER DUDES who are obviously inferior to our hero.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="_blank" >As we all know</a>
 , the condition of one&rsquo;s body has little bearing on their mind and what they can contribute to our communities. As someone who helps organize a skeptical conference in Northern California I found myself thinking how event organizers can take some extra steps to ensure that we don&rsquo;t miss out on hearing any worthy voices in our cause. I asked for some input from skeptics and atheists with disabilities and have a few ideas myself. So, what can we do to make our events accessible to everyone?</p>

<li><strong>Women are nice to look at.</strong> They’re quite often pretty, they have an appealing shape, and our sexuality drives us to want to copulate with them.
2. __Women who are intelligent and/or who agree with our world view are even nicer to look at. __I don’t know a single person in our communities who doesn’t say they are more attracted to other members of our community than they are to people with different views on science, rationalism, and religion.</li>

<p>One of the most often cited ways to encourage diversity within our communities is to promote diversity amongst the speakers we feature at our events. There has been a lot of high-profile success in this - TAM has been approaching 50/50 gender representation, for instance - but there still seem to be a lot of mostly-white, mostly-male speaker rosters and panels. One way that has been proposed for speakers to take action is <a href="http://www.good.is/post/why-white-men-should-refuse-to-be-on-panels-of-all-white-men/" target="_blank" >for white men to decline an invitation to speak at an event or on a panel that lacks diversity</a>
 . Those of us who organize conferences and events have even more power to make a change because we&rsquo;re the one making invitations in the first place.</p>

<p>Despite the annoying pop-over ads, I used to like <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/" target="_blank" >The Good Men Project</a>
 . It seemed to be a site for guys, mostly by guys, about not being horrible in the ways society tries to teach us to be. I mean, they <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/solution-mra-problems-more-feminism/" target="_blank" >had Amanda Marcotte write about MRAs</a>
 , and that&rsquo;s always good stuff. Then something happened. There&rsquo;s still some good content there, sure, but it&rsquo;s been infected by creepiness. You have articles about how <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/why-the-nice-guy-deserves-a-chance/" target="_blank" >stupid women don&rsquo;t date Nice Guys because they&rsquo;re brainwashed by rom-coms</a>

  to a woman who <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/gender-sexuality/rape-culture-men-women-power/" target="_blank" >talks about rape culture</a>
 , a decidedly mixed bag of whining and actually good stuff under the &ldquo;<a href="http://goodmenproject.com/tag/presumption-of-guilt/" target="_blank" >presumption of guilt</a>
 &rdquo; tag, and then the infamous piece by a founder about how <a href="http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/being-a-dude-is-a-good-thing/" target="_blank" >girls are just different from men and should stop being such nagging bitches</a>
 . (I paraphrase.) So, what happened What&rsquo;s going on and why are they acting like jerks? Short answer: No one is perfect, and patriarchy messes with all of us.</p>

<p>Noted anti-racist writer (and decidedly white white-guy) Tim Wise has an excellent piece about the myth of &ldquo;reverse racism&rdquo;, and I encourage you to<a href="http://www.timwise.org/2002/06/honky-wanna-cracker-examining-the-myth-of-reverse-racism/" target="_blank" > read the whole thing</a>
 . My favorite paragraph, though, is this one:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Does making fun of anyone, ever, make you a great person? No. (And I don&rsquo;t claim to be a great person. Comedy often hurts someone&rsquo;s feelings.) But making fun of men, white people, able-bodied people, straight people, etc is simply not the same as someone from those groups making fun of a minority. It really isn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Like many people I was raised in a milieu with more than the usual amount of sexism and racism. I often say &ldquo;I got better&rdquo;, but the truth is, I&rsquo;m <em>getting</em> better. I strive to learn more every day. To be empathic and listen to the experiences of people who are different with me. I work to be a better, more accepting and less horrible person. I&rsquo;m an able-bodied, cisgendered, straight, white man. I may be poor and fat, but I have a lot of privilege. I have the privilege given to me by society to be blind to the casual racism, sexism, ableism, and homophobia all around us.</p>

<p>We live in a diverse world and I think we can all agree that any time a group’s makeup is less diverse than the world at large there are reasons for it. Here in the United States we have more diversity than most places, but when attending nerd events, atheist events, and skeptic events I keep finding myself in the majority. Why is that? I believe it is because something about those groups is making women and racial and sexual minorities feel like the group is Not For Them or are experiencing things that make them feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. I would like to change that.</p>

<p>Typically we find this &ldquo;gem&rdquo; of advice applying to an individual&rsquo;s approach to an important meeting of some sort or even daily life. However, as a &ldquo;First TAMmer&rdquo;, I had the opportunity to do a little role reversal and get a true first impression from the active skeptic community at TAM2012.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a skeptic for a long while, but never really considered seeking out or joining any skeptic community. It never even crossed my mind. However, I had found myself in a position to help out at the <a href="http://cosmoquest.org/" target="_blank" >CosmoQuest</a>
  booth this year, which allowed me to jump into the skeptic scene head first. I had heard many different things about the tumultuous situation happening online, but made a conscious choice to avoid reading it. I wanted to walk into this situation with as little personal bias as possible, and I&rsquo;m really glad I did.</p>

<p>‘Diversity’ is one of those words that people can get tired of hearing very quickly: it makes them feel guilty and insensitive, and it almost always raises acrimonious discussion until it fizzles out, leaving bitter emotions in its wake.  A quick perusal of comment threads (such as <a href="http://skepchick.org/2011/07/the-privilege-delusion/#comments" target="_blank" >here</a>
 , <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2011/07/dawkins_coup_de_grace_in_vegas.php" target="_blank" >here</a>

        The Trouble With Biotruth

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>For those who have been fortunate enough to escape biotruth logic, I&rsquo;ll start by giving a brief summation of the kinds of arguments that fall into that abyss.  When it comes to discussions about gender, they take the following form explicitly, but there is always an implicit context to these arguments (which I will include in brackets as part of the quote):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men are x, women are y.  That&rsquo;s just how humans are; it&rsquo;s biology. [And therefore the behavior you&rsquo;re complaining about is acceptable.]&rdquo;</p>

        Patriarchs?

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>&ldquo;Patriarchy&rdquo; is a term that is often thrown around in feminist circles.  Loosely speaking, it symbolizes the claim that we live in a male dominated society that condescends, controls, and diminishes women.  This is a central tenet of feminism, but is a bit hard to swallow to the uninitiated because it makes it sound like there is some ominous, seemingly-conspiratorial group of men that sits in the upper echelons of society that enacts an anti-woman agenda.  And although there are powerful lawmakers with agendas that are largely in opposition to women&rsquo;s interests, this claim isn&rsquo;t really being made.  However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Patriarchs don&rsquo;t/didn&rsquo;t exist.  Lets peruse some quotations from a few of them.</p>

<p>When Elevatorgate blew up, I didn&rsquo;t get it.  It wasn&rsquo;t that I was firmly in the camp of sexism deniers, but I argued a lot of irrelevent, tangential ideas and failed to understand the central objection that was being raised.  I orbited around the issue for a long time before things really started to click into place, and even now I know I have some hard, mental work left to do.</p>

<p>I’m gonna let you guys in on a little secret today:  science isn’t cheap.  There’s a lot of fundraising that goes on to support the research which leads to the treatments that make life on planet earth longer and better.  Unfortunately not everything gets the financial backing that it deserves.</p>
<p>What causes do and don&rsquo;t get funded?  Well, it isn&rsquo;t always as impartial as you&rsquo;d hope.  Helping men past their prime get it up obviously isn&rsquo;t a very pressing concern, but the prevalence of 80 year olds with limp dicks and disposable income prompted the creation of Viagra over treatments for say&hellip; for Sickle Cell Anemia, which is actually life threatening (unlike erectile dysfunction) but tends to effect minority populations disproportionately.</p>

      <p>###1)  Make Skeptical Events Across the Country Less Alcohol Centric</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re a 20 year old who is passionately invested in skepticism.  You really want to meet others who feel the same way you do and have enlightening conversations with them!  You go online and do a quick look-up of skeptical events held in your area.  &ldquo;Oh hey, Skeptics in the Pub!&rdquo; you exclaim to yourself.  Then it hits you: in the pub&hellip; You&rsquo;re not 21.&amp; &ldquo;Well fuuuck.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>There’s been a lot of talk posted recently about sexual harassment policies, rape jokes, and the like. Somehow people have developed the idea that complaining about harassment is the root problem, and that it’s ok to make jokes about sexual assault. The handful of people who have spoken out against these ideas have been attacked and threatened online. Perhaps this is a general symptom of the internet’s distance and relative anonymity, but I see it as something far worse: a pervasive idea that sexual assault is a women’s problem, and they should deal with it silently and in private.</p>

<p>It is often that I doubt whether or not I truly wish to spend four years of my life here at West Point. The reasons are varied, but the one constant motivator that I have to stay is so that I can be part of the solution to all the issues that I see here.

<em>I know</em>

<p><em>One ex-girlfriend</em>
