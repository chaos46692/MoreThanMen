      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/uploads/2014/08/raperaperape.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;Person 1: You‚Äôre the one that has a problem w/ a safety tool available to women. Or are you one of the ‚Äúteach men not to rape‚Äù girls?!&#xA;Person 2: god forbid anyone teach men not to rape! üòê&#xA;Person 1: You truly believe #rape is taught/untaught?! It isn‚Äôt! That suggests EVERY man is a potential rapist!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw the conversation to the left on Twitter tonight and it made me angry. It made me angry because its ridiculous. If this is the reason why so many people are opposed to rape prevention efforts that prioritize educating men, then all me to say out loud for everyone to hear:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A statement on women&#39;s bodily autonomy and the morally bankrupt cowards who consider it up for debate.</title>

I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize then that the current mostly-male &amp;ldquo;leadership&amp;rdquo; of the secular movement was composed almost entirely of misogynists, abusers, liars, and morally-bankrupt cowards. Those who are not anti-woman seem to be so obsessed with courting &amp;ldquo;allies&amp;rdquo; that they have no problems throwing women under the bus to advance their petty agendas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have supported and also criticized American Atheists over the years. Today I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated and am offering some criticism. Criticism that I hope is listened too. I&amp;rsquo;m an atheist and I want atheist organizations to prosper, but I also want them to reflect my values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today AA issues &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.atheists.org/2013/11/25/disaster-relief/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;a new press release&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; &amp;amp; announcing six new billboards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;American Atheists launched six billboards on Monday in central New Jersey attacking the non-helpful responses by some religions to recent natural disasters. These responses have included praying for the victims and sending bibles and rosaries instead of requested relief supplies that can save lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The privilege of being surprised.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/uploads/2013/10/culturalappropriation.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is an event happening in Ohio on November 2nd that might shock and surprise you for many reasons. It&amp;rsquo;s an event to celebrate&amp;amp; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;D√≠a de Muertos&lt;/em&gt;, the Mexican holiday to commemorate and celebrate reflect upon your dead ancestors and loved ones, with a BDSM play party. We&amp;rsquo;re grown ups and we know people have sex and even have kinky sex in groups. The part that may be a shock for some is that the organizer of the event is a self-described &amp;ldquo;diversity&amp;rdquo; educator. That&amp;rsquo;s right: this crass event of cultural appropriation, where a holiday for remembering your dead friends and family is being used as exotic set dressing for an orgy is being organized by someone who thinks they are &lt;em&gt;helping&lt;/em&gt; fight racism. But if you&amp;rsquo;re surprised, it probably because you&amp;rsquo;re white. Why do I feel comfortable making an assumption like that? Because of how privilege works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Open Letter to Hugo Schwyzer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[MISSING IMAGE]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From one cis hetero white man to another: Shut the fuck up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I realize none of this is likely to make much of a difference to you, because you&amp;rsquo;re not about accountability or criticism. No, not you Hugo. But you&amp;rsquo;re hurting people. You are being an abuser. You are verbally abusing women of color, and then you apologize and cry about your mental illness and &amp;ldquo;go away&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;but you come back. I think you will always come back so long as you feel like you can get away with it. Because I think you like to feel important. It seems that negative attention is almost as good as positive for you, and maybe there&amp;rsquo;s that inner abuser that&amp;rsquo;s really the core of who you are Hugo. Maybe the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Hugo isn&amp;rsquo;t the man who writes about consent, but is instead the man who tried to kill his girlfriend. I think maybe that is the real you. I think maybe you used your mainstream white handsomeness and your abuser&amp;rsquo;s facility at bullshit to talk your way into spaces where you could victimize on a grand scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fellow White People: We&#39;re having the wrong conversation about Miley, Robin, and the VMAs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone is piling on Miley Cyrus for her performance at the Mtv VMAs last night. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen her called &amp;ldquo;skank&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;attention whore&amp;rdquo;, her body being criticized as unwomanly and undesireable, and even someone saying she &amp;ldquo;covered herself in STDs and crack&amp;rdquo;. Others have talked about Robin Thicke and criticized the appropriateness of a married 36 year old dancing in a sexually suggestive way with a 20 year old women. All of those are stupid things to talk about. They are sex negative, misogynist, slut shaming, body policing nonsense. In the &amp;ldquo;STDs and crack&amp;rdquo; line you get bonus racist dog whistles, and as for the whole age-difference and suggestions of infidelity in the Cyrus/Thicke pairing, it&amp;rsquo;s really not any of our place to speculate on what two adults and their partners see, do, or tolerate. Shut &lt;em&gt;all the way&lt;/em&gt; up about any of that for now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to talk about something for years and I think maybe now is the right time to talk about it. I want to show my support for both &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scrible.com/contentview/page/24IG1900IK14P2M300C3G0BQ4KA426A3:40191410/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Karen Stollznow&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; * and &lt;a href=&#34;http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/08/07/carrie-poppy-tells-all/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Carrie Poppy&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  by sharing my own rather unpleasant experiences with DJ Grothe. I want to show that their experiences are not isolated incidents. They are part of a larger picture and are important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sort of known among certain people in the skepticoatheirationalist sphere that DJ Grothe is not terribly fond of me. Back in 2011 I contacted the speakers at that year&amp;rsquo;s TAM and asked them to consider including a mention of the importance of diversity and equality within our communities. Mr. Grothe (and some of the speakers) were not pleased by this. I think that is possibly when he started to dislike me and believe (erroneously) that I wanted to destroy the JREF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As an ally, my words are likely to be given more ‚Äúweight‚Äù in a discussion by many people. There are a lot of reasons for this. The main reason is that I have a lot of social privilege as a straight, white, able-bodied, cis man. I‚Äôm someone who is at the top of a lot of oppression hierarchies. Another reason is that people have this idea of ‚Äúobjectivity‚Äù that is just plain wrong, because no one is objective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was at the Center for Inquiry&amp;rsquo;s second Women in Secularism conference last month. It was one of the best secular conferences I have ever attended and I hope there is another one next year. The staff, especially Melody Hensley did a remarkable job and I applaud them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were two dark clouds at the conference that dampened many people&amp;rsquo;s enjoyment. One was a notorious part time &amp;ldquo;activist&amp;rdquo; and full time attention seeker who attended the conference in order to taunt feminists and report back to his vile, hateful, and dangerous friends at A Voice for Men. The other was Ronald Lindsay, the CEO of the Center for Inquiry, delivering opening remarks that offended many, if nor most, of the attendees and speakers. He then chose not to attend a fundraising dinner (where the people who felt he had insulted them were asked to donate money above and beyond the $250 event ticket) so that he could write a retort to the criticism of his remarks. A retort in which he said some very impolitic and unprofessional things about one of his speakers in particular. I was late arriving at the conference so I missed his talk and haven&amp;rsquo;t said anything publicly about this all. I have, however, been watching to see CFI&amp;rsquo;s response after their board met to discuss the affair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But why don&amp;rsquo;t they turn on the barbarians and stop them?&#xA;‚Äî Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/310618476257607680&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;March 10, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems like such a simple question, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it? I assume Richard Dawkins thinks of himself as a decent person, as most atheists (OF COURSE) are, but why then does he not turn on the racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and ableist &amp;ldquo;barbarians&amp;rdquo; in our midst? Why is Dr. Dawkins not allying himself with his fellow atheists who want to fix within our own community the very same problems he sees as evidence of the evils of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running More Than Men for a year now (even longer if you count the pre-launch preparation we did) and I&amp;rsquo;m more proud than you can know of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and the response we&amp;rsquo;ve generated &amp;ndash; even the backlash from anti-feminists makes me proud. Unfortunately I need to step away for a few month to take care of some personal affairs. It breaks my heart to do so but I can&amp;rsquo;t keep doing this &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; also keep doing the things I need to do in my private life and be successful at either.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over on Twitter the always fantastic &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nataliereed84&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Natalie Reed&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  made a point about something that has been stewing in the back of my head for a while. Thanks to her I now know what to say. I made a handy Storify compilation for you to see what she had to say, below the cut.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//storify.com/sashapixlee/lookism-and-the-face-of-misogyny&#34; &gt;View the story &amp;ldquo;Lookism and the face of misogyny&amp;rdquo; on Storify&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/uploads/2012/12/creepysasha.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See? That dude wasn&amp;rsquo;t really very creepy looking, was he? Now look at this picture of me on the right and pretend you don&amp;rsquo;t know who I am. You just see my picture without knowing I&amp;rsquo;m smart, funny, and run this blog. WHAT A FAT FUCKING NECKBEARD, AM I RIGHT? THAT DUDE IS SERIOUSLY CREEPY AND WEIRD! I WONDER HOW MANY GIGS OF BESTIALITY PORN HE HAS?? It&amp;rsquo;s okay, I get it. &lt;a href=&#34;http://atheiststoday.com/elevatorgate/?p=1979&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;sexist people have (I guess)  pointed it out that I am a weird fatso&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; .

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a week since &lt;a href=&#34;http://skepticink.com/justinvacula/2012/10/04/i-resign-my-leadership-position-with-secular-coalition-for-america/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Justin Vacula resigned&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  from his leadership position with the Secular Coalition for America, but people are still talking about it. I supported, and signed the petition asking for him to be removed. Vacula resigned without any need for the SCA to act. That&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m here for today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a recurring meme from Vacula&amp;rsquo;s defenders and from those who are &amp;ldquo;trying to be neutral.&amp;rdquo; This is regarding &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/feminist-lies-feminism/censorship-and-stupidity-from-free-thinking-feminists/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;the post Justin prepared for &lt;em&gt;A Voice for Men&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . People say &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.atheistrev.com/2012/10/lessons-from-justin-vacula-debacle.html#IDComment460347427&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;we need to judge his post on its own merits&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  and basically ignore where Vacula chose to post it. Bullshit, I say. Ridiculous. To not consider the venue is to not understand the message.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I was really bummed to be unable to attend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MelodyHensley&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Melody Hensley&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; &amp;rsquo;s fantastic, important, and much needed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.womeninsecularism.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Women in Secularism &lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; conference. I was thrilled to learn that there would be a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.womeninsecularism.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;second one&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  and even more thrilled when I saw the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.womeninsecularism.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;fantastic lineup&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  of speakers Melody has recruited. I will be there in May 2013 and you should be, too &amp;ndash; especially if you&amp;rsquo;re a dude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Religion and the cultural we share with the religious has a unique and problematic relationship with women. If we want to use our secularism to improve the world and free people from the grip of religious dogma we need to examine the experiences and problems of all of humanity. Women in Secularism is a great step in that direction. I hope that the continued success of the event will lead to other large conferences on LGBT people, people of color, people with disabilities &amp;ndash; all withing secularism, just where we want everyone to be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;This post is actually part of my homework in Women&amp;rsquo;s Studies this week. I hope I get a good grade.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How to convince men to be allies to women is something I have been trying to master for more than a year now, most actively since I started my blogging project with the new year. It‚Äôs honestly not an easy task. The biggest response I get is a lot of apathy from other men, and then I get the occasional outright enmity from some die-hards I can only call misogynists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but sometimes caring publicly about equality and making a point of being visibly not-horrible can sometimes be exhausting and demoralizing. The relentless and obsessive attacks on people, especially women, who speak out against misogyny and hate really fuck with my head. I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with depression my whole life and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty triggering for me. Many is the evening or weekend I spend holed-up at home because I&amp;rsquo;m just sick of the world and everyone in it. No wonder some of us need to quit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s talking about Atheism Plus, new-new-atheism, social justice atheism, whatever you feel like calling it. I &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/01354_a-call-for-revolutionary-action/&#34; &gt;already shared&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; the thoughts I had been having along those lines, and now I want to really get in to where I stand on things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I support Atheism Plus, at least in so far as I support atheists caring about social justice and equality. If I could be said that I have any reservations or concerns about this new &amp;ldquo;movement&amp;rdquo; it is that apathy will eventually lead to it being a bunch of relatively privileged people paying lip service to social justice and equality, but not really doing much about it. I called for action and I aim to act.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There‚Äôs a mood in the air that had me write an earlier draft of this post.

Jen &lt;a href=&#34;https://freethoughtblogs.com/blaghag/2012/08/atheism/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;followed up&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  with a crowd sourced name for this new wave and a report that grassroots support is, at the moment, growing.

What I find really interesting, and telling, and instructive here is that the picture is obviously intended to cause offense and outrage in the targeted people, Ms. Watson and PZ Myers. In the image, calculated for outrage, he accuses his victims of profitting from &amp;ldquo;manufactured outrage&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here in San Francisco domestic violence has been in the news for all of 2012. The abuser just happens to be our sheriff. I&amp;rsquo;m bringing it up because it&amp;rsquo;s a public case that documents many of the strategies employed by misogynist shitlords when they&amp;rsquo;re confronted by distaste from decent people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ross Mirkarimi was elected sheriff of the city and county of San Francisco in November of 2011. Over New Year&amp;rsquo;s Mirkarimi and his wife Eliana Lopez got into an argument that became physical. Lopez went to a neighbor who &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2012/01/ross_mirkarimi_ivory_madison.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;was a fundraiser for Mirkarimi&amp;rsquo;s election campaign&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . Lopez showed the neighbor bruises and made a video to document the abuse. Lopez told the neighbor that she wanted to document the abuse because of fears that Mirkarimi would take their children away from her. Lopez indicated that she had been telling Mirkarimi that they &amp;ldquo;need help.&amp;rdquo; The next day Lopez contacted the neighbor and implored her not to contact the police about the abuse. Two days after that, on January 4th the neighbor did call the police. The investigation became public on Friday the 6th &amp;ndash; two days before Mirkarimi was due to assume his duties as sheriff. Under a cloud of controversy - but with no charges formally pressed &amp;ndash; Mirkarimi was sworn in as sheriff on January 8th.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m 36 years old and I&amp;rsquo;ve never raped anyone. I recently spent almost a whole day reading that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x6yef/reddits_had_a_few_threads_about_sexual_assault/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;now infamous Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  [&lt;strong&gt;serious trigger warnings for all sorts of awfulness&lt;/strong&gt;] inviting sexual abusers and rapists to tell their side the story. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to read it at first. I read the articles about it. I circled it&amp;hellip;and then like probing an open wound I kept worrying at it. I wanted to understand why. I read and was depressed, sickened, angered. And I noticed some unifying themes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Sunday Surly Amy &lt;a href=&#34;http://skepchick.org/2012/07/ask-surly-amy-how-to-deal-with-hate/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;answered a question from a reader&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  about how to deal with all the vile hate being directed at outspoken women. She provided some examples of the stuff out there being directed at feminist women, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty despicable. I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you reading this have seen it&amp;rsquo;s like before and have asked yourself&amp;amp;  &amp;ldquo;What can I do?&amp;rdquo; The answer is alarmingly simple. You can &lt;strong&gt;speak out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s nothing compared to what women get. The way society tries to silence women is appalling and well documented. It really turns the stomach of anyone with a trace of humanity. Society has other, gentler, ways of silencing and dismissing feminist men, though. I want to talk about those today, not to climb on a cross or to equate what male feminists like me experience to what women encounter, but to show men that they&amp;rsquo;re not alone when these things get hurled at them. I want other men to know they&amp;rsquo;re not alone and that they don&amp;rsquo;t have to be silent or feign neutrality about equality just because society wants them to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since women in the industrialized world have things so good compared to women in countries run by brown religious people and should just STFU already about sexism in their lives, I have prepared a handy list of things you should stop talking about because there are so many worse things happening in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stop writing about or investigating ghosts and cryptozoology at home. Don&amp;rsquo;t you know there are people being killed as witches in Africa?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stop complaining about what religious conservatives are doing in your own country. Aren&amp;rsquo;t you aware that atheism and blasphemy carry a death sentence in other countries?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry your little head about the science curricula in your locals schools. Some countries don&amp;rsquo;t even &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; schools.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Worrying about herd immunity and vaccine denialism in industrialized nations  is pretty stupid when you consider that in some countries people think that raping a virgin cures AIDS.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think you see what I&amp;rsquo;m doing here. My point is that anti-feminists who say &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s worse for women elsewhere, so STFU&amp;rdquo; are hypocrites and are seasoning their hypocrisy with some xenophobic racism. Please remind them of that (or direct them here) when you see them dismiss people working toward equality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As I see it,  what myself and others who talk about the fact that our communities are as subject to sexism (and racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc) as the rest of society are encountering is denialism. Look, we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that skeptics and atheists aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect. Aspiring to an ideal of rationality and fairness doesn&amp;rsquo;t make us perfect, it just means we&amp;rsquo;re trying to be better. As we know, there are prominent skeptics involved in serious legal troubles. There are prominent skeptics with troubling views about climate change. Skeptics and atheists are people, flawed and aspiring to be better &amp;ndash; just like everyone in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This got me thinking of what passes for &amp;ldquo;comedy&amp;rdquo; with most skeptics and atheists. It&amp;rsquo;s shit. Horrible, horrible shit. First you have the &amp;ldquo;science comedians&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;atheist comedians&amp;rdquo; who have tepid, hacky jokes pandering the the interests and opinions of skeptics and atheists.

They seem to be saying that decent people are decent and most people are decent and anyway those online rape threats are just weirdos who never go anywhere and anyway they never saw anyone being sexually harassed at a conference. I think that&amp;rsquo;s how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We atheists know that creationism relies on bad logic and laughable arguments. Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s super interesting (though not at all surprising): anti-feminist creationists and anti-feminist atheists use the same shitty logic and laughable arguments when it comes to crapping on women!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the on Uncommon Descent - a site &amp;ldquo;serving the intelligent design community - someone going by &amp;ldquo;scordova&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.uncommondescent.com/atheism/rebecca-watson-poster-child-of-the-anti-creationists/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;tries to beat up on Rebecca Watson&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  using basically the same ridiculous nonsense reactionary and hateful atheists have been using to try and pillory her about being a woman for years. What&amp;rsquo;s super amusing is that the writer thanks Thunderf00t for tipping them off to how messed up and female Rebecca is. Has Mr. Give-me-leg-biting-or-give-me-death decided that crushing female resistance is more important than his atheistic principles, or did creationists just hear about Ms. Watson&amp;rsquo;s crimes against masculinity through his &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo;? Probably the latter, but the idea of these skeptical atheists who hyperventilate over uppity ladies deciding that feminism is an enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend situation and allying themselves with creationist lunatics is&amp;hellip;sort of delightful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;m sharing a guest post from &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huey_P._Newton&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Huey P. Newton&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; ,  one of the co-founders of  the Black Panther Party. I love, love, love this piece because it represents exactly the kind of self-reflection that inspired me and that we hope to inspire here at More Than Men. This is the entire text of a speech Newton delivered on August 15, 1970. Enjoy.&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;- Sasha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/uploads/2012/06/114630752985471142_GD4a6Gg4_b1-150x150.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the past few years strong movements have developed among women and among homosexuals seeking their liberation. There has been some uncertainty about how to relate to these movements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We not only see that our position is logical and reasonable, but we are passionate about it. We feel about these things very strongly. These issues matter to us very much. It‚Äôs why we‚Äôre so prone to burnout. We pour are hearts into this and it hurts us when we‚Äôre attacked about these things. Since More Than Men started at the beginning of the year I have felt used up and beat up and emotionally exhausted several times, and I don‚Äôt even get the worst sort of abuse. The only rape threat I ever received was from someone who didn‚Äôt even care enough to notice that I‚Äôm a guy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As you‚Äôd expect he‚Äôs experienced some racism and religious bigotry directed at he and his family, especially since 2001. Last August he was asked if that hate was something he had experienced in the publishing trade, to which he replied:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;talking about this or that sector of society as being less or more racist is kind of like talking about this or that part of the ocean being less or more wet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re still working on building &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/harassment-policies/&#34; &gt;our list of secular/skeptical/science events with harassment policies&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . It&amp;rsquo;s grown some since we started, but we need your help. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know about the policy, please comment here with the name of an event you attend or organize and, ideally, a link to their webpage. I&amp;rsquo;ll do the work of tracking down a policy they may have that we can&amp;rsquo;t find.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a non-controversial but important step. The more it becomes the norm for our events to articulate their willingness and desire to make &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; welcome the better things will be for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; who attends. (After we have a good frip on harassment policies I hope to start a similar resource for disability accommodations.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They provide resources to students, educators, and alumni to make schools safer and more welcoming for secularists. They are a true grass roots organization that is training and empowering the next generation of secular leaders and thinkers. They are also more diverse than most secular groups with older memberships. All this is awesome stuff and I‚Äôm a moral as well as financial supporter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We‚Äôve even started building a &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/harassment-policies/&#34; &gt;list of existing harassment policies&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  at conferences as a resource for event organizers, attendees, and speakers. Unfortunately it does seem like a lot of people do think these policies are a bad idea for our events.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One reason I&amp;rsquo;ve seen given in opposition to harassment policies is that they are prudish and they inhibit the ability for adults to express their sexuality. Basically they say that these policies have a &amp;ldquo;chilling&amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;  effect on skeptics and atheists meeting and having sex at conferences. Others argue that &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; having and enforcing these policies have a &amp;ldquo;chilling&amp;rdquo; effect on women attending in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When asked what to do to make skeptic and atheist events feel more safe for women attendees and speakers, Stephanie Zvan blogged about a pretty simple thing to do: institute, &lt;a href=&#34;http://freethoughtblogs.com/almostdiamonds/2012/05/22/making-it-safer-in-the-meantime/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;publicize, and enforce anti-harassment policies&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . This is such an obvious step that I&amp;rsquo;m surprised every event doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clear policy in place. While there are some wild-eyed contrarians (and possible assholes) who think that harassment policies are &lt;a href=&#34;http://freethoughtblogs.com/lousycanuck/2012/05/29/on-the-talibanesque-ness-of-harassment-policies/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;oppressive and horrible&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , most people seem to agree that they&amp;rsquo;re a good idea and Stephanie&amp;rsquo;s post is making some &lt;a href=&#34;http://freethoughtblogs.com/almostdiamonds/2012/05/23/real-progress/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;real progress&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Obviously I disagree but there are well known skeptic speakers who definitely think that those are not a part of ‚Äúscientific skepticism‚Äù and we should instead only talk about ghost lights, psychics, and how stupid Catholics are. The idea seems to be that there was a ‚Äúskeptical canon‚Äù established some time in the mid-20th century and that if we apply skepticism outside that we‚Äôre doing skepticism wrong or are ‚Äúbeing political‚Äù and not rational. On the other hand, lots of skeptics I know think that, for example, cryptozoology is kind of silly and is a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I glibly replied that I am a feminist because I&amp;rsquo;m not a horrible person. The thing is, he&amp;rsquo;s not the only man who seems surprised by men who label themselves as a feminist and who work passionately toward equality for women. Perhaps I ought to explain where I am coming from and why this is important to me. Perhaps that will help other men understand why it should be important to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some people have said that when I see warning signs for misogyny I‚Äôm really just being mean and hateful to people with old fashioned values. I would argue that in many cases ‚Äúold fashioned values‚Äù are misogynist, racist, and homophobic, but apparently some disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some old fashioned values that are used to perpetuate and reinforce bigotry? What are some old fashioned values that are worth keeping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>10 Dating Misogyny Warning Signs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a single guy who uses OkCupid to meet people, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pixlee.net/?p=61&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;occasionally to hilarious effect&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . I also have a lot of women friends who date online and run in to guys who are pretty horrible. It also turns out that not everyone, male or female, is super skilled at spotting misogyny warning signs. That got me thinking ,which now got you this post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of these might seem really obvious, but in my experience these red flags are sometimes missed because when we&amp;rsquo;re looking for romance or sex online we&amp;rsquo;re often trying to see the best in people because we know that expressing yourself through a profile can be hard. It&amp;rsquo;s also true that many of these don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean the guy is a creep, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to proceed with caution when things like this crop up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Often when I am together with pro-equality, feminist, or social justice peeps we talk about how often we‚Äôre disappointed by the prominent men in our communities. Lets be positive for a change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are your progressive male role models? Who has inspired you to be a better person? What particular lessons have you taken from them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He died on Friday, May 4, 2012 ‚Äî only 47 years old ‚Äî from causes related to the cancer he was diagnosed with in 2009. Though only 11 years older than I am, he was one of the men who helped me become a feminist, a progressive, and less horrible over all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago I tweeted a link to this video, because I liked it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5P4eVjwVd_U?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;Shit Men Say to Men Who Say Shit to Women on the Street&#34;&#xA;      &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then someone replied that they&amp;rsquo;d like to see the video about things men &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; say to men who say shit to women on the street. They had a real point. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of silence from men and women both in response to street harassment. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of silence about inappropriate behavior in public in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s often hard to keep promoting diversity in the world. The skeptic an atheist communities have a &amp;ldquo;big tent&amp;rdquo; that celebrates &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Penn_and_Teller#Global_warming_.26_environmentalism&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;misogynists that deny the scientific facts of climate change&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  and &lt;a href=&#34;http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2009/07/bill_maher_gets_the_richard_dawkins_awar.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;rewards misogynists that promote dangerous anti-vaccination nonsense&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  but when we talk about how our movements can and should address and support issues unique to women, racial minorities, and the disabled, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans community we are told we&amp;rsquo;re reaching too far and are out of line. Unless of course foreign brown people are using their religions to hurt those groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you‚Äôre in northern California you should really consider joining us. You can watch me drink whiskey in person!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has got me thinking about skeptic and atheist conferences. What are they for? I&amp;rsquo;m going to let you in on a secret: When I go to conferences and cons (even science fiction and gaming cons) I almost never go to any programming. I usually average about two hours of official content in a weekend. I go to these things for the community. I go to talk and drink and socialize with people who share my beliefs and values.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some even pointed to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sarahdarkmagic/prismatic-art-collection&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;a great Kickstarter projec&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; t to hire artists to create a free library of art depicting diverse heroes for other creators to use.

That debate is whether a man can really call himself a feminist. Some argue that since men have privilege that women do not have we cannot really understand the lives of women and therefore can be pro-feminist nit not actually be called feminists. Others say that this is limiting and is in it‚Äôs own way sexist, creating a women-only club that needlessly excludes male allies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It lets us tell the world &amp;ldquo;Hey, I totally don&amp;rsquo;t mind that you&amp;rsquo;re black/a woman/disabled/queer/trans&amp;rdquo; while also apparently letting us get out of actually acknowledging privilege and oppression. It also lets us change the subject so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep listening to oppressed people&amp;rsquo;s feelings. THe thing is, you can&amp;rsquo;t opt out of society that way. People of color are oppressed. Women are oppressed. Disabled people are oppressed. Queer people are oppressed. Trans people are oppressed. Just because we aren&amp;rsquo;t oppressed and just because we don&amp;rsquo;t personally have a problem with any of those oppressed people doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we get away with just saying &amp;ldquo;I just see people&amp;rdquo; and changing the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I‚Äôve &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/00260_microaggression-or-did-you-know-im-not-perfect/&#34; &gt;written before about microaggressions&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , those tiny, maybe apparently innocuous phrases, questions or comments that make us feel excluded, insulted, or objectified. I had one of those happened to me yesterday. Remember how Wednesday &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/00816_public-bodies/&#34; &gt;I wrote about my body&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  and how my deviation from our cultural ‚Äúnorm‚Äù sometimes makes people feel entitled to treat me as an object? The very next day I was riding my train home from work. I was listening to music and reading. A teenager stopped in front of me and started talking. I paused the music, set down my Kindle and said ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù The kid replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm selling chocolate to raise money for school. Want to help? I know you like candy.‚Äù Because I‚Äôm fat, ya know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s probably too late for you this year, but next year you should consider going to &lt;a href=&#34;http://fogcon.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;FOGcon&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  here in the San Francisco Bay Area. I&amp;rsquo;ll buy you a drink.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, FOGcon has a clearly articulated and posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://fogcon.org/about-fogcon/policies/harassment-policy/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;policy on harassment&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; .

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Jason Thibeault, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/00284_jason-thibeault-the-problem-with-privilege/&#34; &gt;no stranger&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  to these parts, &lt;a href=&#34;http://freethoughtblogs.com/lousycanuck/2012/03/28/underwhelming-response-to-trans-rights-bill-overwhelming-response-to-trans-beauty-queen/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;wrote a great summary of the recent fight&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  to get trans rights legislation passed in Canada. Basically, no one at all is taking the bill seriously. What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is that while &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/petitions/members-of-canadian-parliament-and-senate-pass-bill-c-279-the-trans-rights-bill#&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;the petition&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  to get the MPs and media to take notice is languishing in obscurity there is another petition protesting a trans woman being kicked out of a beauty pageant. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.change.org/petitions/members-of-canadian-parliament-and-senate-pass-bill-c-279-the-trans-rights-bill#&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;The petition&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  to get trans people the rights they deserve and need is being mostly ignored while the petition to protest a cis-normative appearing trans woman being excluded from a venue for objectifying women is crazy popular, guys. The takeaway: Society wants to masturbate to trans people but not allow them any basic rights or dignity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blogs get a lot of searches in the form of questions. Occasionally I will be answering those questions. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll answer a themed group, sometimes it will be a miscellaneous collection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[Even your grandma got called a slut.]&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/uploads/2012/03/grandma_about1-150x150.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;###How do I know if I am a slut?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cynical answer is &amp;ldquo;Someone will tell you.&amp;rdquo; The truth is that &amp;ldquo;slut&amp;rdquo; is, as our friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/00642_a-gentleman-does-not-tackle/&#34; &gt;Matt Gubser has pointed out&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , a stupid insult. Calling a woman a slut or a whore is simply a way of policing and controlling her sexual freedom. Society has a complex about female sexual expression and in the mainstream women are either prudes (not sexual enough) or sluts (too sexual, or sexual in &amp;ldquo;inappropriate&amp;rdquo; ways). Being called a slut or a whore simply means someone has noticed that you have a sexual life and wants to make you feel shitty about it, wants to distract from your actual accomplishments or points (see Limbaugh v. Fluke), or wants to convince people that you&amp;rsquo;re not worthy of associating with. Those people are wrong and are failures at being good people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>David Inwood: Gawking at Women</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/uploads/2012/03/Picture-10.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There seem to be a lot of men that enjoy gawking at hot chicks on the street. No matter how old the man is, whether he is married or single, he sees no problem with checking out all the women in sight. We are men after all, and we find women attractive, and have an urge to look at them. So, why not? It‚Äôs a powerful urge anyway. It‚Äôs almost impossible to resist. So why feel guilty about doing something that is fun, harmless, and that we can‚Äôt even help anyway?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They may also be genuinely secular people who want to share their message with their fellow atheists. In either case I‚Äôm disgusted, angry, and disappointed. What I am not is shocked or surprised. There are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.godlessprolifers.org/home.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;many&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thinkatheist.com/forum/topics/antiabortion-atheists&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;examples&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifenews.com/2012/02/28/confessions-of-a-pro-life-atheist-why-i-fight-abortion/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;anti-abortion atheists&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , and how many are surprised that the late Christopher Hitchens &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/11/28/no-god-and-no-abortions.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;wasn‚Äôt entirely on board&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  with a woman‚Äôs right to choose? The fact is that there are anti-abortionists in our ranks and they have been for some time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Though &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminazi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;he says his friend at the Cato institute coined the word&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , ‚Äúfeminazi‚Äù sure has caught on over the last 20 years. ‚ÄúFeminazi‚Äù is, of course a ridiculous auto-Godwinning slur to throw around but it represents something much more widespread: the fact that the straw feminist is what so many people see as the ‚Äúreal‚Äù feminist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an old joke that anything someone says that follows &amp;quot; I&amp;rsquo;m not a racist, but&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; is always going to be horribly racist. How often do you hear people, especially women say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not a feminist, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and then say something that is, frankly, feminist? When did being a feminist become the moral equivalent, in some people&amp;rsquo;s minds, of racism and homophobia? What&amp;rsquo;s next? &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t hate feminists, some of my best friends are feminists.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sasha here. Of course. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be awfully busy for the next week because in addition to running MTM I work full time and am also recently returned to college. This week school is monopolizing my reading and writing time and I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a lot of guest submissions or &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/00648_remember-when-we-said-help-wanted/&#34; &gt;anyone interested in being a staff writer&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . So, unless I get more time or we get some &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/contribute/&#34; &gt;new submissions&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  I expect this place to be quiet until next week. Sorry about that, but it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yesterday &lt;a href=&#34;https://freethoughtblogs.com/crommunist&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Crommunist&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , who I admire and like, referred to my post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/00726_im-not-a-sexist-but-why-isnt-there-an-international-mens-day/&#34; &gt;International Men‚Äôs Day&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  as an example of &lt;a href=&#34;https://freethoughtblogs.com/crommunist/2012/03/08/show-her-the-money/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;‚Äúwoefully ignorant, knee-jerk reactions to misogyny‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . I‚Äôm not gonna argue with him, but instead see if we can talk about things.&lt;/del&gt; &lt;strong&gt;[Crommunist has clarified. He was referring to the ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt there an International Men‚Äôs Day‚Äù question ‚Äì not my post in reply ‚Äì as woefully ignorant and kneejerk. We are, and always have been, all good.]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you don&amp;rsquo;t know much about the history of the day, I encourage you to look in to it. Pretty awesome stuff. But today I&amp;rsquo;m addressing the inevitable &amp;ldquo;What about the men??&amp;rdquo; cries that we always hear. Last month we heard people (like we do every year) ask why there&amp;rsquo;s no White History Month. (There are 11 of them.) Today some &lt;del&gt;casually sexist&lt;/del&gt; curious people are wondering why isn&amp;rsquo;t there an International Men&amp;rsquo;s Day. Well, the short answer is that &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men%27s_Day&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;there is one&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The student said the teacher just gave hand-outs that half of the students could not read. Later in the article it says that if there were more black teachers that the white teachers couldn‚Äôt hold the minorities back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Friday there was a bit of a kerfuffle about a &lt;a href=&#34;http://atheists.org/blog/2012/03/01/billboard_to_challenge_year_of_the_bible&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;new billboard from American Atheists, Inc&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . The billboard is a response to Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s stupid new &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/item/33315-lawmakers-designate-year-of-the-bible-in-pa&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Year of the Bible&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; &amp;rdquo; as designated by the state legislature. I think most atheists, non-believers, and secularists see the problem with the government decreeing any year a year for Biblical thinking and study - that pesky 1st Amendment we all love. The problem many people had is the imagery and message used in the ad. It struck many of us as racist at worse or insensitive at best. Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This cultural message leads some male skeptics, who should really know better, to have internalized an idea that minorities have biases (because, obviously, they‚Äôre different!) and they do not. I think this is the biggest factor leading to what‚Äôs come to be called ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äú. (When you think about it, ‚Äú[mansplaining]‚Äù(&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mansplain&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mansplain&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; ) is not much different from what many skeptics and atheists do all the time when talk to theists, climate change deniers, creationists, anti-vaxers, etc. The difference here is that they aren‚Äôt really talkinmg facts, they‚Äôre often talking feelings ‚Äì filtered through bias.) As a student of history I‚Äôve learned the lesson all historians have to get really quick: Everyone is biased.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[I asked &lt;a href=&#34;http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Natalie Reed&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  if I could publish this here because she makes a point I have been failing to make, and she makes it much better than I could have.

There‚Äôs not really any need to carry that any further, I feel comfortable with how this resolved and like there isn‚Äôt much left to be said. I also feel for the most part that his comments speak for themselves, and my colleagues at FTB have already done a great job of defending my worth and discussing why his diversity-hire comment was not okay and crossed the line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sam Harris has famously argued that &amp;ldquo;moderate&amp;rdquo;, liberal theists provide cover for religious extremists. I see the same thing happening here. People who defend &amp;ldquo;minor&amp;rdquo; sexist acts and ideas, or who even just avoid talking about it are providing cover and a safe-haven for the people who threaten to rape 15 year old girls on reddit and who actually commit sexual assault and rape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Obviously I think it can, if only because there are some people who are receptive to the message but because of how society trains them they have a harder time hearing and understanding a minority voice. But straight, white, cis, able-bodied men can&amp;rsquo;t be all there is anywhere. Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve got almost two months behind us here it&amp;rsquo;s time to get closer to where I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted us to be all along.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/uploads/2012/02/veritasvp41.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs just not true. I‚Äôm going to admit something right now. I‚Äôm a straight, white guy with a middle-class upbringing. I am also, irrevocably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and probably a host of other -ists and -phobics that you can toss at me. I‚Äôm like this because I‚Äôm a product of a society that is also racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and all the others. I‚Äôve been taught a certain view of normalcy, and as a result, I act with mannerisms that reflect this certain view. It‚Äôs not an attempt to insult; I‚Äôm not consciously discriminatory. But it‚Äôs still there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My good friend and my favorite comedian &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/MattGubser&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Matt Gubser&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  gives his take on the questions I asked on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.morethanmen.org/2012/02/17/we-need-to-talk-sluts-whores/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . This is him working on his bit before it&amp;rsquo;s completely finished, so he&amp;rsquo;s asked that you not judge him by it. I think it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious, though.(Video is NSFW due to some salty language.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My own is a guy who laughed at Christianity because their sole evidence was a book that is a few thousand years old. In the next breath he sang the praises of traditional Chinese &lt;del&gt;magical ground-up penis&lt;/del&gt; herbal medicine, because it&amp;rsquo;s been practiced for thousands of years. In other words what was laughable as evidence for Christianity was compelling evidence for something that appealed to him. What does this mean? This means that rejecting religion doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean rejecting bullshit. According to Christopher Bader&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0814791352/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;tag=sashasdenofiniqu&amp;amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;amp;creativeASIN=0814791352&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;&lt;em&gt;Paranormal America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , 42% of the non-religious believe in the mythical Atlantis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Please explain why you think so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are women responsible for the sexual behavior of men around them if they dress a certain way? Where does that line get drawn? What does that say about men and their agency as humans?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re all forced into this system and we have to reason our way out of it. Just like many of us reject the &amp;ldquo;common sense&amp;rdquo; arguments for religious belief and then we ask questions and gather information and draw a conclusion. Your average theist isn&amp;rsquo;t stupid or evil, they just haven&amp;rsquo;t done the work or had that &amp;ldquo;deconversion&amp;rdquo; moment. When you start kicking and screaming and throwing temper tantrums because someone has challenged your assumptions what does that make you? Does that make you a free-thinker? A skeptic?  No, it makes you a tradition-bound and close-minded person who is being willfully ignorant. When you reject new information because it is inconvenient (or because maybe you just don&amp;rsquo;t trust women, perhaps) &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; you become an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As you look over those you will no doubt see that in every category there is a group with more privilege than the others. Some have less privilege (remember we&amp;rsquo;re talking about special advantages or immunities here) than the &amp;ldquo;top dog&amp;rdquo;, but more than other groups in the category. Got it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A reader hipped me to a video recently. I watched it. I can see the appeal, since it&amp;rsquo;s a video all about being awesomer to people. Something about it didn&amp;rsquo;t sit right with me, though. Here, you watch and then we&amp;rsquo;ll get back together after the jump and compare notes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCxhC4eqaE?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;Are You a Man?&#34;&#xA;      &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so, yes, it&amp;rsquo;s not nice to call people homophobic names. It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you more straight to do so. (I think the only thing that makes men straight - or at least bisexual - is cunnilingus. True story.) I have two problems with the video that won&amp;rsquo;t let me endorse it completely:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You‚Äôll generally see it used in one of two ways: as self-identification by people who consider themselves feminists, and as a pejorative by people who do not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a word with an ugly connotation in many people‚Äôs minds, not unlike the word ‚Äúatheist‚Äù; people hear the ‚Äú-ist‚Äù suffix and infer an ideology that seeks feminine supremacy rather than gender equality, just as many see atheism as a rebellious denial of God rather than an affirmative acceptance of a godless universe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Until this morning I didn&amp;rsquo;t  intend to address it in this space until reading the comment&amp;rsquo;s on PZ&amp;rsquo;s piece filled me with such a dark, bleak sense of despair about the state of humanity and the atheist/skeptical community. So, I&amp;rsquo;d like to start out by stating, very clearly, exactly how I feel about this &amp;ldquo;Amazing&amp;rdquo; guy and his defenders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There&amp;rsquo;s also a way we can help the growing numbers of atheists and free-thinkers of color. It&amp;rsquo;s call the &lt;a href=&#34;http://aahumanism.net/announcements/view/day_of_solidarity_for_black_non_believers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Day of Solidarity for Black Non-Believers&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  and I encourage you to help spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That last link was to a brand new site, &lt;a href=&#34;http://aahumanism.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;African-Americans for Humanism&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , and it&amp;rsquo;s one I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about.

It works like this: Dude likes a lady. I mean he REALLY likes her. She likes him, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t LIKE like him. He is banished to the Friendzone and his penis is dry forever after. What&amp;rsquo;s worse, she keeps being friends with the guy who she has betrayed (by not sucking his dick) and has the audacity to date and copulate with OTHER DUDES who are obviously inferior to our hero.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in your views on privilege from here in England. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how hot you are at proclaiming white, male, heterosexual males to be privileged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I agree to a certain extent, but domestically I feel that class, socio-economic, health and educational attainment are just as important. Therefore, in your mind I&amp;rsquo;m possibly one of those males who you may consider &amp;lsquo;just don&amp;rsquo;t get it&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As someone who helps organize a skeptical conference in Northern California I found myself thinking how event organizers can take some extra steps to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on hearing any worthy voices in our cause. I asked for some input from skeptics and atheists with disabilities and have a few ideas myself. So, what can we do to make our events accessible to everyone?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There has been a lot of high-profile success in this - TAM has been approaching 50/50 gender representation, for instance - but there still seem to be a lot of mostly-white, mostly-male speaker rosters and panels. One way that has been proposed for speakers to take action is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.good.is/post/why-white-men-should-refuse-to-be-on-panels-of-all-white-men/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;for white men to decline an invitation to speak at an event or on a panel that lacks diversity&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . Those of us who organize conferences and events have even more power to make a change because we&amp;rsquo;re the one making invitations in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/uploads/2012/01/4896822030_e7fa872658_m1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite the annoying pop-over ads, I used to like &lt;a href=&#34;http://goodmenproject.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;The Good Men Project&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . It seemed to be a site for guys, mostly by guys, about not being horrible in the ways society tries to teach us to be. I mean, they &lt;a href=&#34;http://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/solution-mra-problems-more-feminism/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;had Amanda Marcotte write about MRAs&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , and that&amp;rsquo;s always good stuff. Then something happened. There&amp;rsquo;s still some good content there, sure, but it&amp;rsquo;s been infected by creepiness. You have articles about how &lt;a href=&#34;http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/why-the-nice-guy-deserves-a-chance/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;stupid women don&amp;rsquo;t date Nice Guys because they&amp;rsquo;re brainwashed by rom-coms&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , &lt;a href=&#34;http://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/why-your-daughter-may-be-the-most-popular-drug-on-the-street/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;creepy patriarchal pieces about sex trafficking where &amp;ldquo;your daughter&amp;rdquo; is equated with a drug&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , &lt;a href=&#34;http://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/bitter-pills-men-and-women-in-rape-culture/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;ridiculous straw-man replies&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  to a woman who &lt;a href=&#34;http://goodmenproject.com/gender-sexuality/rape-culture-men-women-power/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;talks about rape culture&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; , a decidedly mixed bag of whining and actually good stuff under the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goodmenproject.com/tag/presumption-of-guilt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;presumption of guilt&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; &amp;rdquo; tag, and then the infamous piece by a founder about how &lt;a href=&#34;http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/being-a-dude-is-a-good-thing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;girls are just different from men and should stop being such nagging bitches&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA; . (I paraphrase.) So, what happened What&amp;rsquo;s going on and why are they acting like jerks? Short answer: No one is perfect, and patriarchy messes with all of us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You see, men are horribly oppressed when it comes to sex and dating. They need sex so, so bad and stupid women just refuse to give it to them when they ask! It&amp;rsquo;s terribly shocking, I know.

My favorite paragraph, though, is this one:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Does making fun of anyone, ever, make you a great person? No. (And I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be a great person. Comedy often hurts someone&amp;rsquo;s feelings.) But making fun of men, white people, able-bodied people, straight people, etc is simply not the same as someone from those groups making fun of a minority. It really isn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I often say &amp;ldquo;I got better&amp;rdquo;, but the truth is, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;getting&lt;/em&gt; better. I strive to learn more every day. To be empathic and listen to the experiences of people who are different with me. I work to be a better, more accepting and less horrible person. I&amp;rsquo;m an able-bodied, cisgendered, straight, white man. I may be poor and fat, but I have a lot of privilege. I have the privilege given to me by society to be blind to the casual racism, sexism, ableism, and homophobia all around us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Perhaps because our original &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/about/&#34; &gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  was not as clear as it should have been, perhaps because a group of white guys gathering together for something that&amp;rsquo;s not horrible is such a novel concept, but somehow there are people who either have the wrong idea about us or who are skeptical about what we will actually be doing. So let me break it down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I want to talk about a specific &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; here: &amp;ldquo;Y_es, but that&amp;rsquo;s not sexist because he/I/they don&amp;rsquo;t hate &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; women, just that one!_&amp;rdquo; The argument is that since the person slinging gendered slurs doesn&amp;rsquo;t hate women as a class, they aren&amp;rsquo;t a misogynist, therefore they&amp;rsquo;re just a jerk and we we can shut up about this problem and go talk about how dumb Christians are again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here in the United States we have more diversity than most places, but when attending nerd events, atheist events, and skeptic events I keep finding myself in the majority. Why is that? I believe it is because something about those groups is making women and racial and sexual minorities feel like the group is Not For Them or are experiencing things that make them feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. I would like to change that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
