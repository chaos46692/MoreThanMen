      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;hellip;to make a first impression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Typically we find this &amp;ldquo;gem&amp;rdquo; of advice applying to an individual&amp;rsquo;s approach to an important meeting of some sort or even daily life. However, as a &amp;ldquo;First TAMmer&amp;rdquo;, I had the opportunity to do a little role reversal and get a true first impression from the active skeptic community at TAM2012.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a skeptic for a long while, but never really considered seeking out or joining any skeptic community. It never even crossed my mind. However, I had found myself in a position to help out at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://cosmoquest.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;CosmoQuest&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  booth this year, which allowed me to jump into the skeptic scene head first. I had heard many different things about the tumultuous situation happening online, but made a conscious choice to avoid reading it. I wanted to walk into this situation with as little personal bias as possible, and I&amp;rsquo;m really glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
