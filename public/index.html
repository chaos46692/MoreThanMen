<p>More than men has been inactive for a very long time. Unfortunately, due to neglect the WordPress site got hacked and the site was in general disarray.
I wanted to preserve the site, while minimzing the amount of maintanance it took long-term. To that end, I have converted the original to a <a href="https://gohugo.io/">static site</a>
which is more stable, but unfortunately does not include some of the original content like comments and images that were hotlinked (<a href="https://www.pixsy.com/academy/image-owner/hotlinking/">don&rsquo;t hotlink kids!</a>).</p>
<p>The More Than Men project is a campaign by the Women Thinking Free Foundation, a science and critical thinking outreach program focused on women and women‚Äôs issues. With a board of directors that is half men, we realize that white men are in a unique position to provide advocacy for underrepresented groups in almost every field. Men are not the problem, the problem is privilege, and we need to work together to make diversity happen.</p>
<p>More Than Men is a social media project for men to stand up together to take an active role in diversity advocacy, educating people about what diversity outreach is and is not, and dispelling myths about what it means to actively pursue a more inclusive community. This is a chance for men to have a conversation about why diversity matters to them, and how they can benefit, and what they can do to help.</p>
<p>More Than Men is not about apologizing for being male but it is also not about claiming we know better than people what their experiences in the world are like. It is about admitting and embracing who you are, and using that to help build a better community.</p>

          This weekend is a special weekend for me. On Saturday, I will celebrate 11 years of marriage with my brilliant, amazing, strong and determined wife, Elyse. And on Sunday, we will celebrate Elyse‚Äôs birthday, and Father‚Äôs Day.
This weekend, in many ways, is a celebration of my life. The beauty of this weekend is I can share it with those I love most. And while the commercial world says I need to go out and buy something made of steel for our anniversary, and buy some trinket or some other gift for Elyse‚Äôs birthday.

          Being between jobs, I spend a lot of time trying to keep myself busy during the day. I tend to do a lot of chores and small projects that have gone neglected. Over the last 2 months, the small projects have led several afternoon shopping runs. During my shopping runs, I tend to swing through the toy section and see about something small for the kids.
When I was a kid, Barbie dominated the toy section.

I thought that I had written all that needed to be said about the decietful, misogynist, forced-birth advocating, so called &ldquo;secular pro life&rdquo; movement two years ago. I didn&rsquo;t realize then that the current mostly-male &ldquo;leadership&rdquo; of the secular movement was composed almost entirely of misogynists, abusers, liars, and morally-bankrupt cowards. Those who are not anti-woman seem to be so obsessed with courting &ldquo;allies&rdquo; that they have no problems throwing women under the bus to advance their petty agendas.

          I have supported and also criticized American Atheists over the years. Today I&rsquo;m frustrated and am offering some criticism. Criticism that I hope is listened too. I&rsquo;m an atheist and I want atheist organizations to prosper, but I also want them to reflect my values.
Today AA issues a new press release&amp; announcing six new billboards.
 American Atheists launched six billboards on Monday in central New Jersey attacking the non-helpful responses by some religions to recent natural disasters.

          There is an event happening in Ohio on November 2nd that might shock and surprise you for many reasons. It&rsquo;s an event to celebrate&amp; &amp; D√≠a de Muertos, the Mexican holiday to commemorate and celebrate reflect upon your dead ancestors and loved ones, with a BDSM play party. We&rsquo;re grown ups and we know people have sex and even have kinky sex in groups. The part that may be a shock for some is that the organizer of the event is a self-described &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; educator.

          Dear Mr Zuckerberg,
It must be pretty awesome to be a white dude with billions of dollars. It must be nice to be able to afford peace of mind. You do realize that not everyone is a billionaire right? Because when Facebook makes decisions to allow any timeline to be found by name alone that&rsquo;s seriously messed up. Your suggestions to make things more secure are laughable:
   Share each post with the people you want to be able to see it.

          ‚ÄúDo you remember what I did to you last night?‚Äù
That‚Äôs what he asked when I woke, as if asking me to go to breakfast.
I kind of remembered. Then I turned over and felt the pain. He got me drunk, he drugged me, and he fucked me up the ass. I went home with him willingly; I had the hots for him and hoped to play around. But I did-not-would-not-would-never consent to a virtual stranger fucking me.

            Fellow White People: We&#39;re having the wrong conversation about Miley, Robin, and the VMAs

        <div class="f6 f5-l lh-copy nested-copy-line-height nested-links">
          Everyone is piling on Miley Cyrus for her performance at the Mtv VMAs last night. I&rsquo;ve seen her called &ldquo;skank&rdquo;, &ldquo;attention whore&rdquo;, her body being criticized as unwomanly and undesireable, and even someone saying she &ldquo;covered herself in STDs and crack&rdquo;. Others have talked about Robin Thicke and criticized the appropriateness of a married 36 year old dancing in a sexually suggestive way with a 20 year old women. All of those are stupid things to talk about.
