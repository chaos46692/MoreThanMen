Something lighter today. My good friend and my favorite comedian [Matt Gubser](http://twitter.com/#!/MattGubser) gives his take on the questions I asked on [Friday](http://www.morethanmen.org/2012/02/17/we-need-to-talk-sluts-whores/). This is him working on his bit before it's completely finished, so he's asked that you not judge him by it. I think it's hilarious, though.(Video is NSFW due to some salty language.)
