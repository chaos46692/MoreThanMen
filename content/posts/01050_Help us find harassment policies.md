We're still working on building [our list of secular/skeptical/science events with harassment policies]({{< ref "/harassment-policies/" >}}). It's grown some since we started, but we need your help. Even if you don't know about the policy, please comment here with the name of an event you attend or organize and, ideally, a link to their webpage. I'll do the work of tracking down a policy they may have that we can't find.

I think this is a non-controversial but important step. The more it becomes the norm for our events to articulate their willingness and desire to make _everyone_ welcome the better things will be for _everyone_ who attends. (After we have a good frip on harassment policies I hope to start a similar resource for disability accommodations.)
