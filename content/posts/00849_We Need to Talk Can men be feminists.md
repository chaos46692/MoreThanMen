There is a debate within feminism about men. That debate is whether a man can really call himself a feminist. Some argue that since men have privilege that women do not have we cannot really understand the lives of women and therefore can be pro-feminist nit not actually be called feminists. Others say that this is limiting and is in itâ€™s own way sexist, creating a women-only club that needlessly excludes male allies.

___What do you think? Can men ever really be feminists? Is it oppressive or colonialist for men like me to call myself a feminist rather than pro-feminist or a feminist ally?___
