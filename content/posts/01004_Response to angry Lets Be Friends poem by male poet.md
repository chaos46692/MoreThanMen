(More Than Men has addressed “[the friendzone]({{< ref "00516_Nomads of the Friendzone.md" >}})” before. Here’s a poem on a related topic by the Slam Master of Mill City Slam in Lowell, MA. – Sasha)
_I know_
_that if anyone saves me in my hour of need_
_it will be one of my ex-girlfriends._

_One ex-girlfriend_
_got me a job_
_when I was destitute._

_My ex_
_Michele_
_who is a nurse_
_treated the cut on my arm_
_when I didn't have health insurance_
_it would have gone septic she said_
_if I'd waited any longer._

_My ex Rebekah_
_is a lawyer_
_haven't needed her yet_
_but I will._

_All these women_
_still in my life_
_still sharing_
_something_

_Maybe I learned it from my folks_
_married for two years_
_divorced for 25_
_when my father died_
_no one wept_
_harder than my mother._

_And I know_
_it can tear you up_
_to see an old lover_
_with someone else_
_it's bad if they're happy_
_it's worse if they're not._

_But here's the secret_
_when they ask me_
_during the break up_
_if we can still be friends_
_I know they're trying to make an easy out_
_but I laugh_
_because I know something they don't_
_they can't sell me something_
_I've already got._
