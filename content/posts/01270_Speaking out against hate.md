On Sunday Surly Amy [answered a question from a reader](http://skepchick.org/2012/07/ask-surly-amy-how-to-deal-with-hate/) about how to deal with all the vile hate being directed at outspoken women. She provided some examples of the stuff out there being directed at feminist women, and it's pretty despicable. I'm sure most of you reading this have seen it's like before and have asked yourself&  "What can I do?" The answer is alarmingly simple. You can __speak out__.

On [Tuesday](http://skepchick.org/2012/07/speaking-out-against-hate-directed-at-women-david-silverman/),  [Wednesday](http://skepchick.org/2012/07/speaking-out-against-hate-directed-at-women-dale-mcgowan/), and [Thursday](http://skepchick.org/2012/07/speaking-out-against-hate-directed-at-women-ronald-a-lindsay/) Amy posted statements from leaders in the secular and skeptic communities speaking out against the disgusting minority that is trying to silence women. She's asking male leaders in our movements to raise their voices against the horrible people who are trying to steal something important from us and make sure it is a place where their hate and bigotry is welcome.

I have good news for you. You don't have to be famous or be a "leader" to tell these people that you don't agree with them. You can raise your voice here or anywhere else online and say that you a man in the secular and/or skeptic community who disavows this hateful minority. You don't need to be eloquent, just be direct. Tell these jerks you won't put up with them and tell women that you want their contributions.

Comment here and I will highlight your voice. [Email me](mailto:sasha@womenthinking.org) and I will post it for you. Comment elsewhere and let me know where you spoke out and I will link to it. Share this post far and wide and let men know that their voice matters.

This is _not_ men against women, this is positive people against hate. Join us.
