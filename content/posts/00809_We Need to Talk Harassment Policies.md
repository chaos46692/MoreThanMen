After work today I'm heading to literary science fiction/fantasy convention. I'm pretty excited. It's probably too late for you this year, but next year you should consider going to [FOGcon](http://fogcon.org/) here in the San Francisco Bay Area. I'll buy you a drink.

Anyhow, FOGcon has a clearly articulated and posted [policy on harassment](http://fogcon.org/about-fogcon/policies/harassment-policy/). This is something many conventions and conferences do. [TAM has one as well](http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/1354-with-tam-right-around-the-corner-some-important-announcements.html), but there was a bit of a furor over it, including talk of boycotting the event.

__What are the benefits, for you, of their being a clearly stated and enforced policy on harassment? What arguments have you heard against such policies? Is there an argument against a harassment policy being written, posted, and enforced that isn't horrible?__
