I've been running More Than Men for a year now (even longer if you count the pre-launch preparation we did) and I'm more proud than you can know of what I've done and the response we've generated -- even the backlash from anti-feminists makes me proud. Unfortunately I need to step away for a few month to take care of some personal affairs. It breaks my heart to do so but I can't keep doing this _and_ also keep doing the things I need to do in my private life and be successful at either.

I will return to the helm, hopefully around the time of [Women in Secularism 2](http://www.womeninsecularism.org/), but in the mean time I'm leaving you in the capable hands of Carl Tracy. Many of you already know Carl as the person who ran last year's Skepticamp Ohio and [blogged for us about his experiences implementing harassment policies there]({{< ref "01030_Respect as it applies to anti harassment policies.md" >}}). If you don't know Carl, let me assure you he is a great guy and I'm looking forward to seeing what he does around here while I am away. Please let me be the first to welcome him aboard and I hope you will all do the same.

Thanks for a great year, and I promise you'll be hearing from me again soon.
