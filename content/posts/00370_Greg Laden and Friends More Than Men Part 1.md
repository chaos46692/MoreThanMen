[Greg Laden](http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/) has enlisted several people in making a series of three videos for the project. Many thanks to Greg and all his friends (credits in the final chapter). Here's part one. [Part two will be posted tomorrow]({{< ref "00378_Greg Laden and Friends More Than Men Part 2.md" >}}), and [part three on Friday]({{< ref "00387_Greg Laden and Friends More Than Men Part 3" >}}). (Greg took it upon himself to organize this video, the people you see are [Sheril Kirshenbaum](http://sherilkirshenbaum.com/), [Desiree Schell](http://www.skeptic.com/i-am-a-skeptic/Desiree-Schell.html), and [Jafsica](http://www.jafsica.com/).)
