# Archive of More than Men 

## Note from the editor
This page is was up to date as of 2013. Once I get done copy editing everything maybe I will get back to keeping this somewhat current?

Welcome to our ever-expanding list of skeptic, atheist, and science conference harassment policies. As we’ve said, we here at More Than Men are in favor of harassment policies and we want them to be available, visible, and enforced. This page is intended as a public service for event organizers to get ideas for crafting their own policies, and for attendees and speakers so they can be aware of the rules and know what to expect from events they are attending. Consider this an attempt at a skeptic/atheist/science conference version of the Con Anti-Harassment Project’s Con Database.

(Thank you Glynnis!)

This list is far from complete and we appreciate your help. If you can provide us a link to the harassment policy for an event not listed here (or if you find that our link is out of date), please let us know by sending Sasha an email. If you are a conference organizer interested in establishing a policy for your event, you might find the Geek Feminism Wiki’s Conference Anti-harassment Policy helpful.
