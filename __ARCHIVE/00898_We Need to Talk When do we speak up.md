Not too long ago I tweeted a link to this video, because I liked it.

Then someone replied that they'd like to see the video about things men _actually_ say to men who say shit to women on the street. They had a real point. There's a lot of silence from men and women both in response to street harassment. There's a lot of silence about inappropriate behavior in public in general.

___When you have seen street harassment or inappropriate behavior directed at women or minorities, have you said something? Tell us what you said. Have you ever been silent even though you disapproved? Why do we so often hold our tongues in public? How can we change things so that we speak out againts offensive and bullying behavior?___
