_Want to thank the people at More Than Men for having me. To start, I'd like to share a recent post from my own [blog](http://reasonableconversation.wordpress.com), then I'll get to work on some original content. Enjoy!_

& 

You know, I had other things to do. Better things to do. I really, really wanted to stop being a complete asshole and actually answer my email, because I love my friends and I have been an irresponsible ass about that. I know I have, and I really wanted to get back on track and try to stop being a bastard to people I love.

But, unfortunately, I can't seem to get this through my head:

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="266" caption="Why can't I learn this?"]![](http://cdn.unicornbooty.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Dont-try-to-win-over-the-haters.-You-are-not-the-jerk-whisperer.-.jpeg)

So, casually looking over my FB, I see a link to an article posted by a friend of mine that I really respect. She's smart, she's wonderful, she's accomplished. Which is why I thought that the article was satire, because I can never imagine this person who is the embodiment of brains, hard work, and good character buying into something that tells her these are not virtues.

But it's not satire. [This post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tracy-mcmillan/why-youre-not-married_b_822088.html?ref=fb&amp;src=sp&amp;comm_ref=false), by Tracy McMillan pretty much tops my list of "stupid, misogynistic things I've heard women say this week." Maybe this month. Year's also still young, but it'll be in the running.

So, let me summarize for a minute. *ahem* "Ladies, if you really want to get married, and I know you do, you need to stop being a bitch and expecting men to do stuff for you. Let me tell you, married is no picnic, and after a while it'll be nothing but thankless work, but you don't want to be in your mid-thirties and hating your brother's bride, do you?"

Essentially, the entire article is advice to women to lower their standards, settle for anyone willing to tie the knot, and be happy about it. It's like the Donna Reed show, if there was a very special episode in which Donna Reed breaks down crying and tries to slit her wrists, but decides not to since it would stain the laundry.

But enough of my hilarious editorializing in general. Let's get into specifics.

McMillan starts by setting out what she seems to think is a common thing among women. Maybe she's just speaking to certain women who never wanted to get married before. However, then something happens:
> > __1. You're a Bitch._ [Great start, there Tracy. Tell us more!]___
> Here's what I mean by bitch. I mean& _you're angry_. You probably don't think you're angry. You think you're super smart, or if you've been to a lot of therapy, that you're setting boundaries. But the truth is you're pissed. At your mom. At the military-industrial complex. At Sarah Palin. And it's scaring men off.


Fortunately, this pillar of intellectualism, this glorious bastion of wisdom, this...writer for _Mad Men, _she knows exactly what your problem is. In fact, it's actually six problems. And yes, ladies, they're _your_& problems and couldn't possibly have anything to do with the men you've been seeing. My inline comments will be in red.
> > __1. You're a Bitch._ [Great start, there Tracy. Tell us more!]___
> Here's what I mean by bitch. I mean& _you're angry_. You probably don't think you're angry. You think you're super smart, or if you've been to a lot of therapy, that you're setting boundaries. But the truth is you're pissed. At your mom. At the military-industrial complex. At Sarah Palin. And it's scaring men off.


Of course, ladies, you can't actually _be_& super smart, or angry at something specific. And you certainly can't be passionate about things, because passion scares off us menfolk.

On top of telling women that they can never be angry about anything, and certainly not angry about anything important, I want to point out that it's overloaded with conservative dog whistles. It's not just women, it's those touchy-feeling liberal women who might have had problems with their mother, or might not like the military-industrial complex, or may think that Sarah Palin is an idiot who believes...well, basically the same things Tracy McMillan believes. Never forget: everything is political.

So, McMillan thinks that [marriage superstar Kim Kardashian](http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20541325,00.html) is a role model for women trying to get married because that's what her 13 year old would want.

Let's be serious for a second: what does this mean? It means that women shouldn't expect from men any desires above that of a 13 year old. It's nice that she takes a moment out of insulting and stereotyping women to insult and stereotype men, but that doesn't actually make this any less insulting or stereotypical. Men should be expected to be grown ups! The idea that women should be ready to have to deal with somebody who's emotional maturity hasn't risen above puberty is insane and sets a horrendously low expectation for women. How about, instead of preparing for a life of "working around a man's fear and insecurity," you look instead for men who are not afraid and insecure most of the time? Nobody is perfect, and everybody feels bad about themselves or unsure about the future occasionally, but this should not the the thing we plan for. Moreover, they should be ready to deal with your fear and insecurity as well, a point that McMillan misses while blaming your relationship problems on your bitchiness.

> Here's what I mean by bitch. I mean& _you're angry_. You probably don't think you're angry. You think you're super smart, or if you've been to a lot of therapy, that you're setting boundaries.

What this suggestion is saying is that you shouldn't have expectations.


Why shouldn't a woman want to be with somebody who knows what an Eames chair is? Why not one that shares their values other than a willingness to commit? Why not one who thinks Firefly is the greatest show ever (it is), or has read all of _Sandman_, or anything else they damn well want?Yes, you can make the argument that if a woman doesn't care about anything other than if a man is willing to marry her that she'll find a husband. The problem is that "shallow" here is being used to mean "having any interests other than marriage," and it's just as shallow to consider the desire for commitment as the only, singular, and ultimate trait to search for in a husband. If a woman is attracted to tall men, you're telling me she should get over herself and just walk down the aisle with the 5'4" guy (personal note: short guys have better leverage), despite not being attracted to him?

So, sex is like heroin? Plenty of relationships start with people who have random hookups. I know several couples & who are happily married and met shortly before making out at a party, or dancing at a club, or just having a really good date and ended up in bed together. The desire for sex is not a bad thing, and can we please stop this idea that women have to withhold sex from themselves and their partners in order to earn men's respect? The guys who don't respect women who sleep with them are douchebags. Ignore them.</div>

She then goes into how women are chemically conditioned to attach to men who give them orgasms and babies. She goes on to perpetrate [the myth that oxytocin makes it impossible for women to have casual sex because they fall immediately in love with every guy who gives them an orgasm.](http://www.livescience.com/12833-love-hormone-oxytocin-dark-side.html)& You can't boil down complex chemicals to simple concepts like that. It's not how that works.

You know, up until this point, I was totally with her. People _should_& be honest about their expectations and they shouldn't try to lie to somebody hoping to put off the inevitable. And then she has to go and keep talking:
> > __1. You're a Bitch._ [Great start, there Tracy. Tell us more!]___
> Here's what I mean by bitch. I mean& _you're angry_. You probably don't think you're angry. You think you're super smart, or if you've been to a lot of therapy, that you're setting boundaries. But the truth is you're pissed. At your mom. At the military-industrial complex. At Sarah Palin. And it's scaring men off.


I really feel like she got her ideas about how men and women work from a mid-90s sitcom. Men are perfectly capable of becoming emotionally attached to women as well, and women don't need to wait around for men to complete them. And, FSM preserve me in your saucy embrace, stop pretending you know what oxytocin does and how it works because you obviously don't!

I want to get in on her about the idea of using a baby as a prop for& acquiring& male companionship, but I'll give her credit for hedging with "if what you really want is a baby." However, then she has to go and follow up with "Your husband will be along shortly." How do you know that? Is there a formula I'm missing? You have no way of knowing, and a person's personal situation, living conditions, education, other interests (assuming they retained a few for nostalgia value after following point #2), and a number of other factors play a heavy role in this. Just having a baby is not some sort of& guaranteed& lure for good, single men, and it's irresponsible to tell people that.

This last point gets me because it tells women they need to realize their own worth, which is good, but then puts that worth in terms of how good a wife that makes them. A woman's worth is independent of their ability to be a "good wife," whatever that term even means. Marriages are different, they're challenging, no two are exactly alike, and while you can't be happy in a relationship unless you're happy with yourself, it's not about being something for somebody else. It's about being you for you and sharing that with another person. The goal should never be to be a "good wife," it should be to be a good person and to share that with another good person (or several, if you prefer).

I don't have it in me to tear apart the rest in specific, but I will go over details. In the next paragraph McMillan says that you can't be both physically attractive and have character.

Paragraph after that, she says that marriage will not make you happy after the initial glow wears off and you'll just be stuck with twice as much laundry.

Paragraph after that, she says that women don't understand as much about sacrifice for a marriage as men because men automatically give up the one thing in the world they care about more than anything: the ability to fuck anything they want. No, I'm not kidding. Yes, even as I was typing that I was hoping that I was setting up a joke and the answer wasn't going to be the stereotypical "men like to fuck and it's so hard for them not to, women want to be a Disney princess" line. Sorry, Tracy McMillan isn't that clever.

Finally, we get to the end of this mountain of idiocy, insanity, and outright lies.
> > __1. You're a Bitch._ [Great start, there Tracy. Tell us more!]___
> Here's what I mean by bitch. I mean& _you're angry_. You probably don't think you're angry. You think you're super smart, or if you've been to a lot of therapy, that you're setting boundaries. But the truth is you're pissed. At your mom. At the military-industrial complex. At Sarah Palin. And it's scaring men off.


And there we go. The bottom line. Women should expect that they'll be unhappy and that their partner will not contribute because men are unhealthy, flatulent, and slovenly. But by being the perfect woman and loving him "even when they don't deserve it," you'll find love.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is not love. McMillan makes a huge mistake when she recommends a woman "be [her] own dear self" because she just spent an entire article& describing& how she should instead be what she thinks a man wants. If your "own dear self" is [Greta Christina](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CDMQtwIwAw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGUI_ML1qkQE&amp;ei=TBoOT9q1AoLqtgfg9-GoBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGms4vZwMagd4jkoKxzkvtQpcdEuQ), a passionate, smart, opinionated woman who isn't afraid of sex, you might as well forget any sort of real relationship.

This is not good advice. This is awful advice that will lead women to misery because it not only blames them for not being able to find somebody, it lays out very specific things they should be doing and all of them involve subsuming every desire other than the one to be married. If you're& desperate& for marriage at any cost, you're not ready for marriage. You should wait until you actually fall in love with somebody who is also in love with you, the real you, and you can decide together to get married. Husband hunting won't make you happy because you're looking for "someone," not any one specifically.

Does this mean you might not get married? Maybe. But if marriage is about being married and not spending the rest of your life with the person you love, what's the point?
