Yesterday Jason Thibeault, [no stranger](http://www.morethanmen.org/2012/01/17/jason-thibeault-the-problem-with-privilege/) to these parts, [wrote a great summary of the recent fight](http://freethoughtblogs.com/lousycanuck/2012/03/28/underwhelming-response-to-trans-rights-bill-overwhelming-response-to-trans-beauty-queen/) to get trans rights legislation passed in Canada. Basically, no one at all is taking the bill seriously. What's interesting is that while[ the petition](https://www.change.org/petitions/members-of-canadian-parliament-and-senate-pass-bill-c-279-the-trans-rights-bill#) to get the MPs and media to take notice is languishing in obscurity there is another petition protesting a trans woman being kicked out of a beauty pageant. [The petition](https://www.change.org/petitions/members-of-canadian-parliament-and-senate-pass-bill-c-279-the-trans-rights-bill#) to get trans people the rights they deserve and need is being mostly ignored while the petition to protest a cis-normative appearing trans woman being excluded from a venue for objectifying women is crazy popular, guys. The takeaway: Society wants to masturbate to trans people but not allow them any basic rights or dignity.

I'm appalled, and you should be too. Go [read Jason's piece](http://freethoughtblogs.com/lousycanuck/2012/03/28/underwhelming-response-to-trans-rights-bill-overwhelming-response-to-trans-beauty-queen/), then go and sign [the petition](https://www.change.org/petitions/members-of-canadian-parliament-and-senate-pass-bill-c-279-the-trans-rights-bill#). (You do not have to be a Canadian to sign it. I checked.)
