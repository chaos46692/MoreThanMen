We atheists know that creationism relies on bad logic and laughable arguments. Here's what's super interesting (though not at all surprising): anti-feminist creationists and anti-feminist atheists use the same shitty logic and laughable arguments when it comes to crapping on women!

Over the on Uncommon Descent - a site "serving the intelligent design community - someone going by "scordova" [tries to beat up on Rebecca Watson](http://www.uncommondescent.com/atheism/rebecca-watson-poster-child-of-the-anti-creationists/) using basically the same ridiculous nonsense reactionary and hateful atheists have been using to try and pillory her about being a woman for years. What's super amusing is that the writer thanks Thunderf00t for tipping them off to how messed up and female Rebecca is. Has Mr. Give-me-leg-biting-or-give-me-death decided that crushing female resistance is more important than his atheistic principles, or did creationists just hear about Ms. Watson's crimes against masculinity through his "work"? Probably the latter, but the idea of these skeptical atheists who hyperventilate over uppity ladies deciding that feminism is an enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend situation and allying themselves with creationist lunatics is...sort of delightful.

Anyhow, [go read the piece](http://www.uncommondescent.com/atheism/rebecca-watson-poster-child-of-the-anti-creationists/) and wonder at this moment of unity: a creationist making an atheist's arguments. It's pretty spectacular.
