"Patriarchy" is a term that is often thrown around in feminist circles.&  Loosely speaking, it symbolizes the claim that we live in a male dominated society that condescends, controls, and diminishes women.&  This is a central tenet of feminism, but is a bit hard to swallow to the uninitiated because it makes it sound like there is some ominous, seemingly-conspiratorial group of men that sits in the upper echelons of society that enacts an anti-woman agenda.&  And although there are powerful lawmakers with agendas that are largely in opposition to women's interests, this claim isn't really being made.&  However, that doesn't mean that the Patriarchs don't/didn't exist.&  Lets peruse some quotations from a few of them.

[Nietzsche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nietzsche), a philosopher of incredible influence:

> "Woman's love involves injustice and blindness against everything that she does not love... Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at best cows" - in _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_
> 
> "Woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant... she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, and being humble as divine" - in _The Will To Power_

[Aristotle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle), one of the first scientifically-minded polymaths in the history of the western tradition:
> "Woman's love involves injustice and blindness against everything that she does not love... Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at best cows" - in _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_
> 
> "Woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant... she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, and being humble as divine" - in _The Will To Power_

[Hegel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegel), a historian and philosopher who laid the foundation for [Marx ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx)and many others:
> "Woman's love involves injustice and blindness against everything that she does not love... Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at best cows" - in _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_
> 
> "Woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant... she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, and being humble as divine" - in _The Will To Power_

Most of us acknowledge sexism's presence in the religious sphere, but few people expect to find the same bullshit coming from secular philosophers and champions of science and truth.&  In actuality I haven't even scratched the surface:&  Sigmund Freud, Emmanuel Kant, Alexander Pope; the list goes on and on of great, secular thinkers who have perpetuated inaccurate, belittling ideas about women.&  Antiquated notions about women are part of our intellectual DNA from both secular and ascetic intellectuals.&  This is Patriarchy.

If Aristotle can hold such disgusting views of women, is the idea that many people in the skeptic community hold regressive views to a lesser extent really that shocking?&  Being a man of reason didn't prevent any of these great thinkers from being wrong about women.&  None of us should consider ourselves above historical geniuses, and somehow impervious to falling into similar traps.

And by the same token, when the argument is made that Women's Rights isn't a "rationalist topic" you have to ask yourself, well then why did [Bertrand Russell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_russell) (the genius behind the _Principia Mathematica_) [champion it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell%27s_views_on_society#Women.27s_suffrage)?&  [Carl Sagan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_sagan) was a feminist too.
