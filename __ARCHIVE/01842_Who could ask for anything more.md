This weekend is a special weekend for me. & On Saturday, I will celebrate 11 years of marriage with my brilliant, amazing, strong and determined wife, Elyse. & And on Sunday, we will celebrate Elyse’s birthday, and Father’s Day.

This weekend, in many ways, is a celebration of my life. & The beauty of this weekend is I can share it with those I love most. & And while the commercial world says I need to go out and buy something made of steel for our anniversary, and buy some trinket or some other gift for Elyse’s birthday. & The expectation for Elyse is to give me some gift on behalf of our 2 children. & The truth is, this weekend is a celebration of the gifts we have already received.

Elyse has given me strength, courage, and knowledge. & She challenges me daily and expects me to rise to every challenge. & She understands I am not perfect, and never will be. & But with that said, she pushes me toward perfection. & Even if perfection is something we can never achieve, there is no reason we cannot continue to strive to be better.

I am not the man I am today without Elyse. & Her inspiration drives me to be a better person, a better leader, a better father and a better husband. & She never hesitates to call me out. & To hold me accountable for what I say and what I do. & It can be frustrating and even angering, but in the end, she does it so I continue to be a better all around human being.

My gift to Elyse is being a feminist. & Standing by her and fighting for a better world for all people, not just all women. & To help move forward to a world where all of us stand on equal ground. & By no means am I close to being where I need to be, but I am willing to push myself. & I have a long way to go and a lot of work ahead.

And let’s not forget my 2 wonderful children. & Moose and Bug, our amazing son and daughter, remind us everyday why we fight. & They are an inspiration to us.

Moose has overcome so much already in his life. & He was speech delayed, and now he has surpassed many of the kids in his class in reading and speech. & He is about to start his 3rd year of acting school, and now he aspires to play ice hockey. & He continues to amaze me.

Bug is our badass princess who takes shit from no one. & Thursday, she took her first hockey class, and she rocked. & Years ago, Jeremy Roenick, former NHL All-Star and current NBC Sports NHL Analyst, said on the Dan Patrick Show that women had no place playing professional ice hockey with men. & FUCK YOU, ROENICK! & My little girl can dominate if she wants.

What could be a greater gift this weekend than my family. & They are the inspiration for everything I do, and for who I am. & They are worth every moment of sacrifice I make. & It truly is a labor of love.

Happy Birthday, Elyse. & Thank you for 12 years and 10 months of sharing your life with me. & Thank you for giving me the honor of being your husband for the past 11 years. & Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your life and your family. & And, thank you for 2 amazing kids.

I love you.
