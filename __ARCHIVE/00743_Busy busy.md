Sasha here. Of course. I'm going to be awfully busy for the next week because in addition to running MTM I work full time and am also recently returned to college. This week school is monopolizing my reading and writing time and I haven't had a lot of guest submissions or [anyone interested in being a staff writer](http://www.morethanmen.org/2012/02/21/remember-when-we-said-help-wanted/). So, unless I get more time or we get some [new submissions](http://www.morethanmen.org/contribute/) I expect this place to be quiet until next week. Sorry about that, but it is what it is.

To tide you over today I'll direct you to the excellent new [Black Skeptics post](http://freethoughtblogs.com/blackskeptics/2012/03/12/slaves-like-us-american-atheists-on-the-plantation/) about the AA ads I said that I, as a white dude, [wasn't really qualified to address](http://www.morethanmen.org/2012/03/05/who-gets-to-decide-whats-racist/).
