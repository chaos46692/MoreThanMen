This year I was really bummed to be unable to attend [Melody Hensley](https://twitter.com/MelodyHensley)'s fantastic, important, and much needed [Women in Secularism ](http://www.womeninsecularism.org/)conference. I was thrilled to learn that there would be a [second one](http://www.womeninsecularism.org/) and even more thrilled when I saw the [fantastic lineup](http://www.womeninsecularism.org/) of speakers Melody has recruited. I will be there in May 2013 and you should be, too -- especially if you're a dude.

Religion and the cultural we share with the religious has a unique and problematic relationship with women. If we want to use our secularism to improve the world and free people from the grip of religious dogma we need to examine the experiences and problems of all of humanity. Women in Secularism is a great step in that direction. I hope that the continued success of the event will lead to other large conferences on LGBT people, people of color, people with disabilities -- all withing secularism, just where we want everyone to be.

Mark your calendars for May 17-19, 2003. [Register for the conference](http://www.womeninsecularism.org/). Let me know you're attending. I'll be there and I'm looking forward to learning a lot with each other.
