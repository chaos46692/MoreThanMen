More The Men is not about me, it's about all men speaking out in favor of diversity. [Last week](http://www.morethanmen.org/2012/07/27/speaking-out-against-hate/) I asked people to comment here, [email me](mailto:sasha@womenthinking.org), or link me to comments elsewhere where they, as ordinary guys, speak out against the recent campaign of misogynistic abuse directed at women in our communities. Many of you took a stand and told the haters that you are _not_ on their side:

> We don’t need or want people like that as part of our community. Nobody does.

Your voice matters. Please add it to our chorus today.
