This has got me thinking about skeptic and atheist conferences. What are they for? I'm going to let you in on a secret: When I go to conferences and cons (even science fiction and gaming cons) I almost never go to any programming. I usually average about two hours of official content in a weekend. I go to these things for the community. I go to talk and drink and socialize with people who share my beliefs and values.

___What do you attend skeptic and atheist events for? Do you go for the community or do you go for the content?___
