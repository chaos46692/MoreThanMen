One reason I've seen given in opposition to harassment policies is that they are prudish and they inhibit the ability for adults to express their sexuality. Basically they say that these policies have a "chilling"&  effect on skeptics and atheists meeting and having sex at conferences. Others argue that _not_ having and enforcing these policies have a "chilling" effect on women attending in large numbers.

___Do policies regarding appropriate behavior at events inhibit anyone's ability for consensual sex at these events? Is it the responsibility for skeptic and atheist event organizers to facilitate or even take in to account the ability of attendees to have sex at their events?___
