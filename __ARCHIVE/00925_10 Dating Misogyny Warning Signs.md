I'm a single guy who uses OkCupid to meet people, [occasionally to hilarious effect](http://www.pixlee.net/?p=61). I also have a lot of women friends who date online and run in to guys who are pretty horrible. It also turns out that not everyone, male or female, is super skilled at spotting misogyny warning signs. That got me thinking ,which now got you this post.

A lot of these might seem really obvious, but in my experience these red flags are sometimes missed because when we're looking for romance or sex online we're often trying to see the best in people because we know that expressing yourself through a profile can be hard. It's also true that many of these don't necessarily mean the guy is a creep, but it's a good idea to proceed with caution when things like this crop up.

Let the screen shot parade begin!

What this guy is saying here is: "I really hate it when chicks are super picky and only date dudes they find attractive and appealing. Also, your job is a boner-killer." It's also quite possible that when he says he wants someone who brings out the "bad boy" side of a man he's interested in freaky sex with questionable consent. Or he really, really wants to cuddle while watching Will Smith and Martin Lawrence together.
