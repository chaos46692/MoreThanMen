###1)&  Make Skeptical Events Across the Country Less Alcohol Centric

Imagine you're a 20 year old who is passionately invested in skepticism.&  You really want to meet others who feel the same way you do and have enlightening conversations with them!&  You go online and do a quick look-up of skeptical events held in your area.&  "Oh hey, Skeptics in the Pub!" you exclaim to yourself.&  Then it hits you: in the pub... You're not 21.&  "Well fuuuck."

Young people aren't the only ones pushed to the side here either.&  Some people don't feel comfortable in bars.&  There are a multitude of potential reasons for wanting to avoid this kind of environment.&  Whether you're a woman who doesn't like being harassed by drunk men or a recovering alcoholic, you should be able to find a skeptical event to attend that doesn't involve alcohol.

I also wonder if men wouldn't behave better towards female attendees as a whole if alcohol wasn't a central component of many skeptical meetups.&  Obviously drunkenness doesn't excuse poor behavior even if it contributes to it, but it's a thought none the less.


###2)&  More Anti-Harassment Policies

As More Than Men previously covered, The Amazing Meeting's anti-harassment policy has resulted in some controversy.&  A couple of people have even threatened to boycott the event.&  It's incredibly depressing that we're part of a community where people think being told not to harass other people is somehow unreasonable and cause for threats of non-participation.&  There's a damn good way to change this though:&  make anti-harassment policies universally prevalent in our movement.

We should double down rather than back away.&  Getting this done would be as easy as passing around a petition and handing it off to the leaders of every skeptical organization out there big and small.&  When this becomes the norm, we'll be much healthier as a movement.&  Men attending skeptical events aren't being told not to express their interest in fellow attendees in a conscientious manner, all that's being said by these policies is this:&  creepiness can get right the fuck out.


###3)&  We Need More Prominent and Diverse Female Leaders

It's great that a large number of high profile female skeptics are friends and co-activists like the folks at Skepchick, but there are plenty of great women out there doing their own thing who need recognition too.&  Providing a vision of monolithic feminism, tight female activists, or anything else just makes it easier for the assholes to generalize and marginalize the role of women in Skepticism.

Have a woman blogger you know of who writes about scientific and skeptical concepts on her own?&  Help promote her!&  Pass around word of her involvement through social media.

There's a danger to having all of the diversity in our movement clustered together in one place, we need more widespread variance.
