- & <del>[The Canadian government says "Screw You" to married gays](http://unicornbooty.com/blog/2012/01/12/canadian-govt-dissolves-thousands-of-same-sex-marriages-including-dan-savages/) - Seriously dudes, the last thing equality (and your legacy) needs is an international, gay "Dred Scott" decision. Oh, you're fixing it? You're fucking with people's rights. Not privileges, rights. </del>[Looks like Canada ["fixed" it](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/justice-minister-declares-all-same-sex-marriages-legal-and-valid/article2301691/), but why can something like this even happen? Oh, I know: hate + apathy.]
- [There's this Women in Secularism conference happening in May](http://www.womeninsecularism.org/). I can't make it, but you should go if you can.
	- [Unquestioned Privilege](http://skepchick.org/2012/01/unquestioned-privilege/) is a great post about rudeness and [microaggression ](http://www.morethanmen.org/2012/01/11/microaggressions-or-did-you-know-im-not-perfect/)over on Skepchick.
	- [The skepchicks are also using delicious cookies to fight hate](http://skepchick.org/2012/01/buy-girlscout-cookies/). And if you're a vegan, I have some [good news for you](http://www.ecovegangal.com/2011/03/yes-you-can-buy-vegan-girl-scout.html).
	- [The Libertarian candidate for president wants to fight homophobia...with racism](http://dailycaller.com/2012/01/09/gary-johnson-obama-opposes-same-sex-marriage-because-of-black-voters/). I don't expect much from Libertarians, but still.
	- [Women ask for promotions and raises as often as men](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/for-women-in-business-the-squeaky-wheel-doesnt-get-the-grease/2012/01/09/gIQAGRuqlP_story.html?tid=sm_twitter_washingtonpost). Still don't get them as often, or for as much. I wonder why?
