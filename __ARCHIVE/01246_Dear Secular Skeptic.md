Since women in the industrialized world have things so good compared to women in countries run by brown religious people and should just STFU already about sexism in their lives, I have prepared a handy list of things you should stop talking about because there are so many worse things happening in the world.

- Stop writing about or investigating ghosts and cryptozoology at home. Don't you know there are people being killed as witches in Africa?
	- Stop complaining about what religious conservatives are doing in your own country. Aren't you aware that atheism and blasphemy carry a death sentence in other countries?
	- Don't worry your little head about the science curricula in your locals schools. Some countries don't even _have_ schools.
	- Worrying about herd immunity and vaccine denialism in industrialized nations&  is pretty stupid when you consider that in some countries people think that raping a virgin cures AIDS.

I think you see what I'm doing here. My point is that anti-feminists who say "It's worse for women elsewhere, so STFU" are hypocrites and are seasoning their hypocrisy with some xenophobic racism. Please remind them of that (or direct them here) when you see them dismiss people working toward equality.
